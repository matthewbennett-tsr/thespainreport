    - 300 Passengers Evacuated After Marseille-Madrid High-Speed AVE Train Catches
      Fire In France
    - Eight people were lightly injured after breaking windows to escape the burning
      train.
    - "A Spanish AVE high-speed train travelling between Marseille (France) and Madrid
      caught fire at 8 a.m. on Sunday morning shortly after leaving the station at
      Lunel, 20km from Marseille, a spokesman for Spanish train operator RENFE confirmed
      to The Spain Report by telephone.\r\n\r\nThe initial cause of the accident,
      he said, appeared to have been a fire in the engine of \"a modified S100\" model
      high-speed train, \"which had then also caused damage to the overhead line\".\r\n\r\nTwo
      French news sites reported between seven and eight people were treated for light
      injuries after breaking windows to escape the burning train, and that two of
      them had been taken to hospital to receive stitches in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe
      spokesman said the high-speed train had been carrying around 300 passengers,
      who had been evacuated and taken by bus to Montpellier and then put on trains
      to their destinations in Barcelona, Zaragoza or Madrid.\r\n\r\nRENFE and S100
      manufacturer Alstom would be responsible for investigating the causes of the
      accident, he added.\r\n\r\nChristine Rahard-Burnat, head of communications for
      Alstom, told The Spain Report by telephone that it was \"too soon\" to know
      what had happened or make \"any official comment\" but that the company's response
      would depend on the exact details of the incident and the contractual and insurance
      situation of the damaged machine."

    - Greek F-16 Crash In Albacete Likely Caused By A NATO Checklist Moving A Key
      Rudder Control Switch
    - The Greek F-16 stalled just two seconds after takeoff and slammed into the ground
      five seconds later.
    - "The Greek F16 that crashed on take off at Albacete’s Los Llanos airbase in
      Spain’s Castilla La Mancha region in January was not properly prepared for take
      off, “drastically affecting the aerodynamics of the aircraft”, a report by the
      French Defence Ministry has concluded.\r\n\r\nThe pilot’s efforts to recover
      controlled flight were “insufficient” to prevent the aircraft from crashing
      “approximately 7.8 seconds after takeoff” into the apron area, where several
      other military aircraft were preparing to take part in NATO’s Tactical Leadership
      Programme.\r\n\r\nA French Mirage 2000, a French Alpha Jet and an Italian AMX
      aircraft were “totally destroyed” and a further five aircraft, including an
      American F-15E, were damaged.\r\n\r\nThe Greek F-16 was carrying hundreds of
      gallons of extra fuel in external fuel tanks and stalled 2 seconds after it
      left the ground. The aircraft’s afterburner was engaged for takeoff and up to
      the point of impact.\r\n\r\n“The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and
      post-impact fire.”\r\n\r\nThe pilot in the rear seat of the F16 initiated the
      ejection sequence but did so outside of the ejection seats’ safety envelope,
      killing both Greek aviators along with nine French air force personnel on the
      ground.\r\n\r\n<h2>Checklist Nudges Key Switch</h2>\r\n\r\nThe leading cause
      of the accident, says the report, was an improper setting of the trim tabs for
      the yaw axis of the F-16, along with a small change in pre-take off pilot habits.\r\n\r\nAn
      aircraft’s yaw is the left-to-right movement of an aircraft, controlled via
      the rudder.\r\n\r\nThe rudder trim, a control surface used to affect minor changes
      to rudder input: “was inadvertent [sic] set to maximum right yaw trimming (12º
      right), drastically affecting the aerodynamics of the aircraft during takeoff”.\r\n\r\nThe
      report describes how the rudder trim setting can only be set manually by the
      pilot in the forward cockpit of the two-seat F-16D and that the “F-16 is not
      equipped with a system which provides an advisory to the pilot when mistrimming
      conditions exist prior to/during takeoff”.\r\n\r\nGiven the manual input needed
      to change the rudder trim inside the forward cockpit, the Defence Ministry report
      postulates: “the possibility of a checklist temporary [sic] being placed on
      the FWD left cockpit console cannot be excluded”.\r\n\r\nThe pilots had been
      given extra checklists that day related to the NATO Tactical Leadership Programme
      they had been participating in.\r\n\r\n“Both trims (yaw and roll) seem to have
      been unintentionally moved by an object. SIB investigators showed that movement
      of a blocked checklist across the trim panel can cause the same near simultaneous
      roll and yaw trim movements as recorded if done so in a particular manner.”\r\n\r\nThe
      rudder was still set to “-12º (right)” when the aircraft began its takeoff sequence,
      and the pilot made several hard left rudder inputs during take off to try to
      maintain alignment with the runway, and then to a lesser degree shortly after
      the aircraft left the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter taking off, though, the F-16’s nose
      quickly shifted 12º to the the right and also rolled down and to the right,
      with the roll increasing until it hit the ground, despite the pilot trying to
      move the aircraft back to the left.\r\n\r\nThe French Defence Ministry said
      there was also a significant change in pre-takeoff pilot habits.\r\n\r\n“The
      change to the ‘End of Runway Inspection’ order led the pilot to change his standardization
      order and consequently the “Before Takeoff” checklist was conducted earlier
      in the launch sequence than normal. This procedural change modified the standard
      pilot’s habit patterns.”\r\n\r\nThe two pilots were medically fit, rested and
      qualified to fly the F16 on January 26."

    - Three Spanish Journalists Missing In Syria
    - The last tweets by two of the men were published 11 days ago.
    - "Spanish daily ABC <a href=\"http://www.abc.es/espana/20150721/abci-secuestrados-siria-espanoles-201507211714.html\">reported</a>
      three Spanish journalists had been kidnapped in the Syrian city of Aleppo at
      some point in the last 10 days.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper said Antonio Pampliega,
      José Manuel López y Ángel Sastre had been in the country working on a freelance
      basis.\r\n\r\nSpanish news agency EFE <a href=\"http://www.rtve.es/noticias/20150721/tres-periodistas-espanoles-freelance-secuestrados-siria/1184522.shtml\">confirmed</a>
      the news, citing confirmation from the Spanish Federation of Press Associations
      (FAPE).\r\n\r\nEFE also reported the Spanish Foreign Office was \"aware\" of
      the situation.\r\n\r\nNeither ABC nor EFE reported who had kidnapped the three
      men. In initial reports, both ABC and FAPE had talked of a kidnapping, which
      they later changed to 'missing' or 'detained'.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Foreign Office
      had not responded to a request from The Spain Report for comment and confirmation
      at the time of publication.\r\n\r\nSpanish journalists on Twitter reported the
      Spanish government was suggesting the men were \"missing\".\r\n\r\nTwo of the
      three men, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/europapress/status/619450692688846848\">Antonio
      Pampliega</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AngelMSastre/status/619498241793597441\">Ángel
      Sastre</a>, last tweeted 11 days ago on July 10.\r\n\r\nMr. Sastre's last message

    - Spanish Parliament To Vote On New Greek Bailout
    - The parliamentary debate and vote will likely take place in August.
    - "Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced in Congress on Wednesday morning
      that he would submit Spain's participation in the new Greek bailout, estimated
      at around €10 billion, to debate and a vote in the Spanish parliament.\r\n\r\nThe
      Prime Minister said it was \"difficult to qualify\" Mr. Tsipras's negotiating
      strategy and that Greek people would now feel frustrated.\r\n\r\n\"It will be
      more difficult to avoid the frustration of a part of the Greek people who, led
      to reject one set of proposals not much more than a week ago, now has to accept
      another, more demanding, set because the situation is much more serious. It
      will be difficult but it can be overcome.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rajoy said he was \"fully
      ready to see the matter concluded in the best way possible\", and repeated that
      he believed Mr. Tsipras's decisions since January had led Greece from a situation
      of nascent economic growth to an \"unsustainable\" current outcome.\r\n\r\nA
      parliamentary debate followed by a vote is not obligatory under the Spanish
      system, said the Prime Minister, whose governing Popular Party (PP) has a 10-seat
      majority, 185 seats in total, in the 350 seat chamber.\r\n\r\nNo date has been
      set for the vote. El País reported it would likely take place at some point
      in August, following a formal petition by Economy Minister Luis de Guindos.\r\n\r\nThe
      German, Finnish, Austrian, Dutch, Estonian and Slovak parliaments will also
      debate and vote on the new Greek bailout.\r\n\r\nMr. Rajoy refused to allow
      the Spanish bank bailout to be debated in Congress, despite requests to do so
      from opposition parties."

    - Spain Advises Citizens Not To Travel To Tunisia
    - Spanish Foreign Office says the threat is “especially acute” during Ramadan.
    - "Spain updated its travel advice for Tunisia on Friday, recommending all non-essential
      travel to the country be avoided during the month of Ramadan, advising \"extreme
      precaution\" if travel were necessary and avoiding certain areas altogether.
      \r\n\r\nThe Spanish Foreign Office did not recommend Spanish citizens currently
      in Tunisia leave the country, as the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office <a
      href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia\">did</a> on Thursday.\r\n\r\nA
      statement <a href=\"http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Portal/es/ServiciosAlCiudadano/SiViajasAlExtranjero/Paginas/DetalleRecomendacion.aspx?IdP=185\">posted</a>
      on the Spanish Foreign Office website, dated July 10, said the new recommendations
      have been made in the wake of the terror attack in Sousse on June 26, the attack
      on the Bardo Museum in March, and the state of emergency declared by President
      Essebsi on July 4.\r\n\r\n\"The threat of terrorist actions or hostage taking
      of foreigners is especially acute during the Ramadan period, which will last
      until the middle of July. It is therefore recommended that non essential travel
      to the country during that time be avoided.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sousse attack <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/16935/spain-convenes-anti-jihadi-terror-group-meeting-after-attack-on-spanish-hotel-in-tunisia-kills-27/\">took
      place</a> on the beach of the five-star Imperial Marhaba Hotel owned by Spanish
      group RIU.\r\n\r\nSpain's previous travel advice to Tunisia, dated July 4, had
      only recommended \"extreme precaution during the trip\", stopping short of advising
      Spaniards not to travel to the country.\r\n\r\nBoth notes advise not travelling
      at all to \"remote areas and the Sahara desert\" on the borders with Algeria
      and Libya, which is described as a \"restricted military access zone subject
      to authorisation\", and the western Kasserine region.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Foreign
      Office and the Spanish Embassy in Tunisia had not responded to a request for
      comment on Saturday morning at the time of publication."

    - Artur Mas Calls Early Regional Elections In Catalonia
    - No mention was made of the “plebiscite” nature pro-secession forces wish to
      give the regional elections.
    - "Catalan First Minister Artur Mas signed the decree calling early regional elections
      in Catalonia on Monday evening, at a brief ceremony in Barcelona.\r\n\r\nThey
      will take place on September 27 and the election campaign will begin on September
      11, Catalonia's national day and the scene of large pro-independence demonstrations
      in recent years.\r\n\r\nMr. Mas said the lack of \"cordial dialogue\" meant
      an \"exceptional\" situation had been created between Madrid and Barcelona,
      which justified the calling of early regional elections in Catalonia.\r\n\r\nHe
      had previously called early elections after a dispute with Mariano Rajoy in
      September 2012. They were held on November 25, 2012, meaning the new elections
      will be held less than three years later.\r\n\r\nMr. Mas said that Catalans
      \"are a nation of free people\", with \"the right to decide our future\", and
      with \"a horizon of hope\"; he also spoke of his desire \"for a better country\"
      but stopped short of mentioning independence, secession, referendums or plebiscite,
      lest the central government in Madrid choose to present another legal challenge
      at the Constitutional Court.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, pro-independence political parties
      and civic organisations <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/17312/pro-independence-groups-in-catalonia-to-fight-elections-as-joint-force-in-new-challenge-to-madrid/\">decided</a>
      to present a joint pro-secession electoral list at the elections.\r\n\r\nOn
      June 11, Spain's Constitutional Court <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/16673/spains-constitutional-court-declares-catalan-preparations-for-november-9-vote-unconstitutional/\">ruled</a>
      unanimously that the Catalan government’s preparations for the “citizen participation
      process” on Catalan independence on November 9, 2014 had been wholly unconstitutional. "

    - Catalan Government Presents New Tax Agencies Plan
    - Madrid says the plan is “not going anywhere” and that it will not allow separatist
      challenges.
    - "The Catalan government presented proposals on Monday for a new tax model for
      the region, should it secede from Spain, based on the Australian and Swedish
      revenue collection agencies and the idea of an encouraging smart tax in place
      of repressive control measures.\r\n\r\nThe regional government commissioned
      10 studies and came up with a four-agency model that would include a Catalan
      Tax Agency, a Catalan Revenue Agency, a Catalan Foreign Trade & Customs Agency
      and a Catalan Real-Estate Property Agency.\r\n\r\nA regional finance minister
      would be in charge and the workings overseen by a parliamentary tax council.\r\n\r\n“Time
      has not been wasted, much work has been done and now we have not only a big
      chance in front of us but also the big need of 7.5 million Catalan citizens”,
      said Catalan First Minister Artur Mas.\r\n\r\n“Without the control of your own
      tax agency”, he added: “even though it would be in a framework of European cooperation
      as we want, there is no self government, and without self government there is
      no national project”.\r\n\r\nEl País reported the Catalan government wanted
      to make it clear to voters before the regional elections in September—which
      Mr. Mas and his allies mean to turn into a referendum on independence—that it
      was ready to begin exercising that self-determination.\r\n\r\nThe regional economy
      minister, Andreu Mas-Colell, said that the region was now “much better prepared
      for what might happen”.\r\n\r\nSpanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Sáenz de
      Santamaría said Mr. Mas’s tax agency proposals were “not going anywhere”, and
      Popular Party spokesman Pablo Casado said the government would not allow “any
      kind of separatist challenge”.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish government has not specified
      how it would attempt to stop Catalan secessionists from preceding with their
      plans should they win regional elections set for September."

    - Catalonia Is Missing Out On A Huge Party
    - 'Santiago Roncagliolo is a Peruvian writer who lives in Barcelona. This article
      was originally published in Spanish in El País on July 24. “Barcelona”, suggests
      Mr. Roncagliolo: “was once New York. Now it is set on becoming Latvia”.'
    - "(<img src=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/santiago-roncagliolo.jpg\"
      style=\"float:left; width:75px; margin-right:10px;\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/twitroncagliolo\">Santiago
      Roncagliolo</a> is a Peruvian writer who lives in Barcelona. This article was
      originally published in Spanish in <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/08/opinion/1436372508_577976.html\">El
      País</a> on July 24. \"Barcelona\", suggests Mr. Roncagliolo: \"was once New
      York. Now it is set on becoming Latvia\".)\r\n<hr />\r\nA couple of months ago,
      I travelled from Barcelona to Madrid for the presentation of the Peruvian poet
      Carlos Germán Belli. I did so out of admiration but also out of solidarity,
      because I thought that, being a foreign poet, it would not exactly be a rousing
      success. Every audience member would count. Luckily, I was wrong.\r\n\r\nThere
      were around 150 people at the event, which took place at the Casa de América.
      Rumours abound that Belli might win the Cervantes prize, so representatives
      from cultural institutions like the Real Academia or the Instituto Cervantes
      were in attendance, along with other Peruvian and Latin American writers. Mario
      Vargas Llosa read one of Belli’s texts and José Manuel Caballero Bonald spoke
      of the relationship between his poetry and that of the honoured guest. He did
      not really know him personally but felt linked to him by a common language and
      literary tradition.\r\n\r\nYes, this year a lovely homage to Gabriel García
      Márquez was organised in Barcelona but any writer who does not have a Nobel
      Prize, is not dead or, above all, has not lived in Catalonia, has little chance.
      The Spanish language is not supported by the state, and the cultural world has
      its own problems to worry about. There is a Catalan Casa de América that does
      what it can, but its resources are few. It is very illustrative that this Casa
      does not even have its own premises, it is located on an upper ground floor.
      For years, it could not even display a visible sign on the street below (and
      the one they have now is not very visible either, truth be told).\r\n\r\nBut
      at Belli’s poetry event, I discovered something much more alarming: Latin Americans
      who work in my field—writers, publishers, journalists—are getting out of Barcelona.
      I thought for a while they were leaving Spain because of the economic crisis,
      but in Madrid I found out that many of them had moved to the capital and that
      none of them are now making the journey in the other direction, the journey
      I myself made, the journey that before was quite normal.\r\n\r\nNone of these
      friends and acquaintances have left because they are anti-Catalan or anti-nationalist.
      None of them would say politics has had anything to do with their decision.
      They have just found work there. But that is the precise consequence of what
      is happening in Catalan politics: nowadays, if you write in Spanish, your life
      is elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen I mention this in Catalonia, the nationalists tell
      me this is happening because Madrid is the capital city: there is more money,
      more movement, more of everything. But that argument ignores their own history.
      For writers in Spanish, Barcelona was always much more important than any capital
      city. As Xavi Ayén said in his wonderful “Aquellos años del boom” (“Those boom
      years”), the great moment for Latin American literature was forged in Catalonia.
      Far from Franco and close to France, the city became Spain’s door to Europe.
      And when I got here ten years ago, that was still the case. The intellectuals
      getting out of Barcelona today prove of course that they were previously here.
      Madrid was never able to take them away, and today Barcelona is giving them
      away, convincingly giving up its own privileged place.\r\n\r\nThe critic and
      publisher Andreu Jaume warned in El País on June 19 that Barcelona’s place as
      the country’s publishing capital “is in danger due to a political carelessness
      that is now beginning to foster a cultural diaspora”. I would add blindness
      to carelessness. Because this break up responds to the conflict some Catalan
      politicians have with Spain, but Spanish is not the language of Spain: it is
      the language of five hundred million people and the second most spoken language
      in the world. Spaniards are not even the largest Spanish-speaking community,
      or the most important. If Hispanics in the US were a country, they would be
      in the G20. In this gigantic universe, full of creative energy, Barcelona was
      always New York. Now it is set on becoming Latvia.\r\n\r\nI fear, though, that
      this is not a mistake, or collateral damage, but a voluntary, deliberate act.
      As with all nationalism, the Catalan version is based on the conviction of one’s
      own superiority compared to others. The Catalan nationalist believes he is more
      efficient, more modern and better educated than the man in Andalusia or Galicia,
      and he sums up all of those qualities in the concept of being “more European”.
      Generally speaking, many Europeans are convinced they are better than others,
      and don’t make much of the xenophobic stench given off by believing one’s origins
      to be a virtue. That I’ve become used, but faced with people who believe themselves
      to be more European than other Europeans, what might an American hope for? The
      contempt a Catalan nationalist feels for Spain is what we represent.\r\n\r\nBeyond
      matters of sensitivity, though, is it really a good idea to scorn all of these
      people? All of those countries? Spanish is the second language in the United
      States. It opens doors to Japan and China through relations among Pacific countries.
      The cultural power of this phenomenon is not limited to books, but extends to
      all areas of communication. A Hispanic country, Mexico, hosts the second largest
      publishing exhibition in the world, in Guadalajara. Spanish is the second most
      popular language on Twitter. Latin American fiction is broadcast on TV screens
      in Croatia, Russia and Australia. Is it possible to look down on the whole planet?\r\n\r\nOf
      course it isn’t. What is possible is to find oneself alone. Insomuch as Catalonia
      defends its identity as different from all of the others, it loses ways to make
      itself heard in the world. There is a party out there, and those of us who live
      here are missing out on it.\r\n\r\nCatalonia was never the closed province nationalists
      want to build. If the Hispanic world has admired anything about Catalonia, it
      is its cosmopolitan spirit and openness. For decades, its perfect bilingualism
      was the sign of a well-educated society, both proud of itself and open to dialogue.
      The protection of the Catalan language in the education system was an example
      for American indigenous languages, before it became the complete opposite: an
      attempt to erase the other.\r\n\r\nThe paradox is desolating: based on an elevated
      concept of their own cosmopolitanism, the nationalists are building a more provincial
      society, no matter how big their flags in squares and stadiums, no matter how
      much they shout in Catalan and English, and no matter how many embassies they
      want to open. Their only cultural project is to hurry Catalonia proudly towards
      irrelevance."

    - Spain's Markets & Competition Commission Fines 20 Car Companies €171 Million
      For Cartel Practices
    - Volkswagen Audi, SEAT and Porsche escape €39.4 million in fines after collaborating
      with authorities.
    - "Spain's National Markets &amp; Competition Commission (CNMC) has announced
      a record €171 million fine for 20 car manufacturers and distributors for practices
      it believes \"constitute a cartel\", the commission said in a <a href=\"http://cnmc.es/Portals/0/Notas%20de%20prensa/150728_NP_Sancionador_Fabricantes_coches_def_ok.pdf\">press
      release</a>.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish subsidiaries of Citroën, BMW, Chrysler, Chevrolet,
      Fiat, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Nissan, Peugeot,
      Renault, Toyota and Volvo have been fined between €265,50 and €22.8 million.\r\n\r\nThe
      smallest fine, of €256,50, was for Chrysler España SL, and the largest fine,
      of €22.8 million, for General Motors España SLU.\r\n\r\nThe commission \"considers
      it proven that those sanctioned exchanged commercially sensitive and strategic
      information in the Spanish vehicle distribution and after-sales market for the
      brands involved\", adding the activities took place across Spain in marketing,
      after-sales and business management.\r\n\r\nThe CNMC says the companies broke
      Article 1 of Spain's Competition Defence Act and Article 101 of the Treaty on
      the Functioning of the European Union, related to the \"systematic exchange
      of sensitive commercially confidential information\", covering \"practically
      all\" activities from new and used vehicle sales to workshop and repair services.\r\n\r\nThe
      companies control 91% of the Spanish car market and acted in such a way as to
      \"secretly hide\" their exchanges of information.\r\n\r\nThe CNMC says two consulting
      companies, Urban Science and Snap-On, facilitated the exchange of data between
      February 2006 and August 2013.\r\n\r\nThe secretive deals and cartel behaviour
      led to an \"artificial decrease in uncertainty\" regarding the companies' commercial
      policies and \"lower discounts\" and \"less aggressive commercial policies\"
      for Spanish car buyers.\r\n\r\nVolkswagen Audi, SEAT and Porsche were not fined
      after collaborating with the CNMC by \"providing sufficient proof to order the
      inspections carried out\" to uncover the cartel system.\r\n\r\nBy collaborating,
      the three companies avoided fines of €39.4 million.\r\n\r\nThe companies have
      two months to appeal the fines at the National High Court in Madrid."

    - Regional Government Blocks Nuclear Waste Dump Hours After Spain's Nuclear Council
      Approves It
    - Socialist regional government increases the size of a national park and bird
      protection area.
    - "The regional government in Castilla La Mancha, led by Socialist Party (PSOE)
      First Minister Emiliano García Page, has moved to block the construction of
      a nuclear waste dump in the town of Villar de Cañas just hours after Spain's
      Nuclear Security Council gave the green light for preliminary construction work
      to begin.\r\n\r\nEl Mundo <a href=\"http://www.elmundo.es/espana/2015/07/28/55b758be46163fe11f8b457c.html\">reported</a>
      a regional government cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning had decided to increase
      the size of a nearby natural park and bird protection area from 2,500 acres
      to 62,000 acres, thus prohibiting any construction work from beginning in the
      area.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Spain's Nuclear Security Council gave the green light
      to the construction of a nuclear waste dump in Villar de Cañas (Castilla La
      Mancha), where radioactive waste is to be stored for up to 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe
      council said that the design of the nuclear waste dump should be reinforced
      compared to earlier proposals to take into account the geological environment
      near the town.\r\n\r\nThe council's decision will be sent to the Industry Ministry
      for administrative approval for the commencement of the building and infrastructure
      work.\r\n\r\nThe decision to propose Villar de Cañas as the location for the
      dump was one of the first taken by Mariano Rajoy's new Popular Party government
      when it came to power in 2011."

    - Popular Party Would Be Big Winner Of Popular Party Electoral Reform Proposals,
      El Mundo Reports
    - PSOE rejected the proposals last week but the PP holds an overall majority in
      parliament.
    - "The big winner of the fast-track electoral reform being proposed by Mariano
      Rajoy's Popular Party would be Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party, El Mundo <a href=\"http://www.elmundo.es/grafico/espana/2015/07/28/55b6919622601d48488b45a7.html\">reported</a>,
      citing a study by its own journalists.\r\n\r\nIf the proposals became law and
      were applied to May's local election results, the PP would win power in 219
      additional towns across Spain. The Spanish Socialist Party would lose power
      in 151.\r\n\r\nConservative parties such as the Basque Nationalist Party or
      the now defunct CiU in Catalonia would benefit, whilst a variety of left-wing
      or left-wing regionalist parties would lose out.\r\n\r\nCiudadanos, considered
      a potential alternative to the PP for conservative votes, would also lose.\r\n\r\nThe
      town halls the Popular Party would win manage the daily lives of 3.7 million
      Spaniards, 87% of the total population that would be affected by the changes.\r\n\r\nThe
      current system in Spain requires parties to obtain 40%-45% of the vote to win an
      overall majority.\r\n\r\nThe new proposal would allow the party with the most
      votes to govern, if that party won at least 35% of the vote and were five points
      clear of its nearest rival, or if a party won at least 30% of the vote and were 10
      points clear of its closest rival.\r\n\r\nIf no party won more than 30% of the
      vote, a second round ballot would be held in which any party with more than
      15% of the vote in the first round could participate.\r\n\r\nThe news measures
      would have led to a second-round vote in Spain's five biggest cities—Madrid,
      Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla and Zaragoza—where the Popular Party was ousted
      from power on May 24.\r\n\r\nSpanish Socialist Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sánchez rejected
      the proposal last week, saying it was clear that \"the winner is the party in
      power\" and that the PP was making proposals \"suited to its fears and its inability
      to reach agreements\"."

    - Spain's Unemployment Rate Falls To 22.37% In Second Quarter But Most Are Summer
      Tourism Jobs
    - Mariano Rajoy boasted Spain was now creating half the jobs in Europe.
    - "Spain's unemployment rate fell to 22.37%, or 5.15 million Spaniards, in the
      second quarter of 2015, according to one of the two major indicators used to
      measure the creation or destruction of jobs in the country.\r\n\r\nThursday's
      figure represent a 1.12% improvement on the previous quarter and a 2.96% improvement
      over the last 12 months.\r\n\r\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, speaking
      at an economic conference on Thursday morning, said that \"never in our economic
      history had so many jobs been created in one quarter\", adding that: \"We have
      gone from creating half of Europe's unemployment to creating half its jobs\".\r\n\r\nThe
      National Statistics Institute's <a href=\"http://www.ine.es/daco/daco42/daco4211/epa0215.pdf\">Active
      Population Survey</a> (EPA) said 411,800 jobs—defined as \"at least one hour
      of work\" in the week preceding the survey—had been created in the second quarter
      in Spain, a three-month period that almost always sees net job creation because
      of the tourism industry.\r\n\r\nApproximately three-quarters of the new jobs
      created in the second quarter were temporary contracts (307,600) in the service
      sector (291,700).\r\n\r\nLuz Rodriguez, employment spokeswoman for the Spanish
      Socialist Party (PSOE), said the Popular Party's idea of recovery was all based
      on temporary jobs.\r\n\r\n\"Good jobs are being replaced by jobs with a sell-by
      date\", she said: \"more than a million people are working with a temporary
      contract and part-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Labour uncertainty is the Brand Spain the
      PP is going to leave behind, with contracts that last less than two months on
      average, and 25% less than seven days.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the percentage unemployment
      rate (22.37%) and the total number of unemployed Spaniards (5.15 million) are
      the lowest figures since the fourth quarter of 2011, which will likely allow
      Mariano Rajoy to claim economic victory over the policies of his Socialist Party
      predecessor, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, in the run up to the general election,
      despite Mr. Rajoy presiding over historic increases in both figures to the end
      of 2012.\r\n\r\nThe size of the active population—those available for work—has
      stabilised in a band between 22.8 and 23 million people, after falling from
      23.5 million in 2012.\r\n\r\nUnemployment in the southern region of Andalusia
      and the western region of Extremadura remained above 28%.\r\n\r\nIn Madrid,
      Aragón, Navarra, La Rioja and the Basque Country, the unemployment rate is below
      18%.\r\n\r\nThe other measure of Spanish unemployment, the monthly figure published
      by the Employment Ministry, <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/17023/worst-june-jobs-figure-for-rajoy-since-he-took-office/\">showed</a>
      there were 4.12 million unemployed Spaniards in June."

    - Pro-Independence Groups In Catalonia To Fight Elections As Joint Force In New
      Challenge To Madrid
    - Esquerra's national council ratifies the deal. Artur Mas would likely continue
      as first minister.
    - "Pro-independence political parties and civic associations in Catalonia have
      agreed to present a joint electoral list at the still unannounced early regional
      elections set for September 27.\r\n\r\nA meeting took place on Tuesday evening
      between Artur Mas (CDC), Oriol Junqueras (ERC, Esquerra) and the leaders of
      the region's three biggest pro-independence associations, the ANC, Òminum Cultural
      and the Association of Pro-Independence Municipalities (AMI).\r\n\r\nThe announcement
      of the joint list represents a new challenge to the central government in Madrid.
      The Constitutional Court ruled any kind of referendum or preparations for one
      about what it considers an issue of national importance to be unconstitutional.
      In April 2014, the Spanish parliament rejected the region's formal request for
      a vote on the matter.\r\n\r\nLa Vanguardia reported that while the top three
      positions on the new electoral list—normally reserved for the candidate for
      first minister and his close allies—will not be occupied either by Artur Mas
      or Oriol Junqueras (they have agreed to run third and fourth), should the group
      win the election, Mr. Mas will still be proposed as the new first minister of
      a coalition government whose goal would be secession from Spain.\r\n\r\nThe
      first three places will likely be filled by independent pro-secession candidates.\r\n\r\nIn
      the latest regional CEO survey published at the beginning of July, support for
      a 'no' vote to Catalan independence increased to 50%, leading the 'yes' vote
      by seven points.\r\n\r\nEl Periódico reported Mr. Junqueras would be a deputy
      first minister and that the two parties, CDC and ERC, would split the rest of
      the positions in the new regional government 60-40%. The paper also reported
      Mr. Mas has threatened not to call early elections if the electoral list was
      made up entirely of non-politicians, a move that convinced ERC to accept the
      deal.\r\n\r\nAn 18-month plan towards secession would be used to attempt to
      negotiate independence from Spain.\r\n\r\nERC's national council ratified the
      agreement on Tuesday evening, \"to shouts of 'independence'\" the party said
      in a statement e-mailed to journalists, following an \"intense\" debate and
      to \"allow [the elections] to serve as a means for Catalan people to vote on
      independence\".\r\n\r\nThe party said the nature of the elections on September
      27 would thus be \"clearly a plebiscite\", and that the agreement would also
      serve to specify the steps to be taken following a victory for pro-independence
      forces: \"to constitute a new state and advance in the construction of a cleaner,
      more just country\".\r\n\r\nSpanish law does not allow regional governments
      to organise plebiscite elections or referendums on questions of national importance.
      Mr. Mas is attempting to convert them into one by bringing together all pro-independence
      forces under a single banner for voters, a strategy he has now mostly achieved.\r\n\r\nHe
      first suggested the idea of a unitary \"first minister's list\" of pro-independence
      forces at the end of November 2014, with early regional elections as early as
      March, but Mr. Junqueras rejected the offer.\r\n\r\nThe new agreement has received
      the backing of civic associations in the region, although the Catalan National
      Assembly (ANC) issued a statement on Tuesday night saying that while the ANC
      regarded the deal as \"positive\", their full support depended on the details,
      which they asked the political parties to work on as a matter of urgency.\r\n\r\nA
      third pro-independence party, CUP, however, decided not to join the single electoral
      list because it included professional politicians. An unnamed party source told
      La Vanguardia that Artur Mas had \"launched a takeover bid on the independence
      movement\".\r\n\r\nThe Spanish government had not responded to the news on Tuesday
      night."

    - UPyD Elects Andrés Herzog As New Leader
    - Founder Rosa Díez steps down after the party's share of the vote fell to 1%
      in the recent elections.
    - "Members of Union, Progress &amp; Democracy elected Andrés Herzog as their new
      leader in a ballot at the party's leadership council in Madrid on Saturday.\r\n\r\nMr.
      Herzog received 43% of the vote (802 ballots), Irene Lozano 37% (745 ballots),
      José Antonio Rueda 12% and Julián Domingo 3%, the party said in a series of
      tweets.\r\n\r\nSpeaking after the results were announced, Mr. Herzog said \"tomorrow
      we must all work together\" and that \"our enemies our out there\", whilst recognising
      UPyD had had a \"difficult\" year.\r\n\r\nOutgoing leader Rosa Díez said the
      party was not \"content to change the government, we think we need to change
      the regime. And we are fighting that battle\". She <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/16503/rosa-diez-announces-she-will-not-run-to-lead-upyd-after-dismal-result-in-local-elections/\">announced</a>

    - 'Zapatagate: Right Outcome, Lots Of Questions'
    - Will other Spanish parties now apply the same strict ethical yardstick to their
      own politicians?
    - "Guillermo Zapata, the new councillor in Madrid responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/16779/new-ahora-madrid-councillors-already-in-trouble-for-offensive-tweets-on-jews-murder-and-terror-victims/\">offensive
      tweets</a> in 2011 and 2012 against Jews, murder and terror victims, resigned
      or was <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/16798/carmena-sacks-ahora-madrid-culture-councillor-zapata-over-offensive-tweets-after-just-48-hours/\">sacked</a>
      by the new Ahora Madrid mayor of the Spanish capital, Manuela Carmena—it is
      not entirely clear which—and one of Spain’s new ‘alternative left” parties,
      related to Podemos and described on Monday by the Prime Minister as “radical,
      extremist and very far left”, has both lost a battle straight after entering
      power and won a battle by responding more quickly and with a better eye for
      that very rare commodity in Spanish politics—political accountability—than any
      of the existing establishment parties.\r\n\r\nMr. Zapata’s ouster is the right
      outcome following a ferocious media and political onslaught over the past 48
      hours that quickly spread from Spain to Israel and even the New York Times.
      It is likely the conclusion that would have been expected by voters in most
      other democratic countries, but it raises a host of questions about the new
      ethical measuring stick in Spanish politics and about how Ahora Madrid has chosen
      and manages its councillors.\r\n\r\nMr. Zapata is no longer Madrid’s culture
      czar but he is still a councillor representing a district of Madrid: why is
      it right to resign from one set of public responsibilities and not the other?
      Why should Mr. Zapata have to resign, or be sacked, but Pablo Soto, another
      Ahora Madrid councillor who also tweeted a few years ago about his enthusiasm
      for the guillotine, the assassination of ministers and starting revolutions
      with a Kalashnikov, get to keep his job? What will now happen if Mrs. Carmena
      appoints a replacement who also turns out to have been a little too loose lipped
      on Twitter?\r\n\r\nOne possible substitute—if Mr. Zapata were to resign as a
      councillor altogether—is 23-year-old Alba López Mendiola, number 21 on the Ahora
      Madrid electoral list. She has already been caught and has already deleted her
      Twitter account today. Spanish newspapers are publishing screenshots of her
      old comments in which she variously laughed at a Lieutenant Colonel killed falling
      off a roof while trying to hoist the Spanish flag, described herself as a “feminazi,
      attempt at Marxist-Leninist” or wished that Emilio Botín, the deceased former
      chairman of Santander, had died a more excruciating death “like the people who
      committed suicide after being evicted by his bank”.\r\n\r\nThere are also serious
      questions about how the Ahora Madrid councillors got into Madrid City Hall in
      the first place. Nominally, Mrs. Carmena, as the new mayor, is in charge, but
      given the confluence of political forces that make up the new party, her real
      ability to appoint and dismiss people is being questioned, as is the real influence
      held by Podemos, whose leaders were present at her appointment ceremony on Saturday,
      cheering and applauding.\r\n\r\nAhora Madrid held primary elections to elect
      the members of its open electoral list, and voters then got to vote for the
      whole list at the local elections. Which is to say some people—party members—had
      some say in who got on the list but all voters did not then get to cast a ballot
      for individuals on it but rather the whole list, or some other party’s list.
      Some candidates’ hot-headed online activism was undoubtedly part of their appeal
      and personal brand to get them elected in the first place.\r\n\r\nOpen lists
      are one way some Spanish parties have tried to improve on the traditionally
      fully closed-list system where loyalty flows upwards to the boss, not downwards
      to the voters. That system has been widely criticised by experts and activists
      alike since the economic crisis began, but this scandal highlights one of the
      failings of that way of trying to fix Spanish politics. Voters as a whole still
      had to vote for the brand, not for the individual politicians. Would Mr. Zapata,
      Mr. Soto or Ms. Mendiola have been elected if voters and not just party members
      had had a say in the matter?\r\n\r\nFinally, having thrashed Manuela Carmena
      and Guillermo Zapata with it, will Spain’s political parties and newspapers
      now use this new yardstick on their own politicians and public appointees? If
      the new ethical barrier is to be offensive, insulting, racist, hate-inducing
      or xenophobic tweets written some years previously, the list of Spanish politicians
      who in theory need to resign this week could be very long indeed. In the meantime,
      and notwithstanding the police investigation into any criminal liability for
      Mr. Zapata’s tweets, Mrs. Carmena can chalk up a quick reaction to an explosive
      political scandal that would otherwise have drawn attention away from whatever
      she is now set to do in her first 100 days in office. Voters might even reward
      her quick response."

    - Spain’s New Popular Fronts And The General Election
    - "“Anyone but the PP” has, in the end, been the battle cry around which the left
      has coalesced."
    - "The Popular Front was formed by republican, leftist, trade unionist, communist
      and Marxist parties in Spain at the end of December 1935 to fight the elections
      announced for February 1936, which it won. Modern-day leftists in Spain have
      repeatedly denied any such new Popular Front is about be formed. Today, the
      rhetorical battle is fought over “transversality”, the “corrupt caste”, the
      end of traditional bipartisan politics and “change”, perhaps the ultimate “empty
      signifier”. Podemos, led by Pablo Iglesias, has strived, and largely succeeded,
      in changing the frame within which political debate in Spain it taking place
      and so successful has their use of the media environment been that other parties
      on both sides of the political spectrum are still reacting to their discourse.\r\n\r\nWriting
      recently in the New Left Review, Mr. Iglesias himself explained what Podemos
      was trying to do, concluding that the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE): “will
      either accept the leadership of Podemos of commit political suicide by submitting
      to that of the PP”. In a document titled “Opening Podemos” published last week,
      senior Podemos leader Pablo Echenique and others expressed an alternative view
      for the direction the party should take towards the general election in the
      autumn, noting that: “the virus of change adopts multiple forms”. Juan Carlos
      Monedero, who resigned not long ago from the party leadership, has suggested
      adapting the Podemos brand for the general election by changing its name to
      something like “Ahora Podemos” (Podemos Now), “Podemos Por El Cambio” (Podemos
      For Change) or “Podemos Somos Mayoría” (Podemos We’re A Majority), in order
      to bring together other parties and forces under a common banner.\r\n\r\nPodemos
      did not participate in Spain’s local elections as a party or a brand, instead
      deciding to support and take part in a seemingly endless list of alternate “citizen
      platforms” with names like Now X, X In Common, Participate X, Let’s Change X,
      For X Yes We Can or Let’s Win X. On Saturday, those platforms took real power
      in Spain for the first time as their candidates became mayors in the Spanish
      capital Madrid as well as in Barcelona, Zaragoza, Badalona, Santiago de Compostela,
      Cádiz and La Coruña. They now control the daily lives and public budgets of
      5.9 million Spaniards in major cities, without tallying their success in smaller
      towns and villages across the country.\r\n\r\nIn Madrid, as the Ahora Madrid
      (Now Madrid) candidate Manuela Carmena was handed the mayor’s baton, Pablo Iglesias,
      Iñigo Errejón and Juan Carlos Monedero applauded, laughed and made jokes from
      the visitors’ gallery. In Barcelona, Ms. Colau promised “the government of happiness”,
      as did ‘Kichi’, the new Podemos mayor of the southern city of Cádiz. In Valencia,
      Joan Ribó, from the Valencian nationalist party Compromís, said he did not need
      either the mayor’s stick or the power to command it represented because “I prefer
      dialogue”. Cheers and applause and shouts of the Podemos battle cry “Sí se puede!”
      (“Yes we can!”) could be heard in both Madrid and Barcelona, as hundreds or
      thousands of supporters waited outside to celebrate the “return of the people”
      to local government, in many cases after decades of Popular Party rule.\r\n\r\nAcross
      Spain, the Podemos options have proven capable of reaching agreements with the
      Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE), United Left (IU) and regionalist or nationalist
      parties such as Republican Catalan Left (ERC), the Basque Nationalist Party
      (PNV), EH Bildu—the party most linked by other parties to terror group ETA—and
      the Valencian nationalists of Compromís. Mariano Rajoy’s Popular Party now controls
      just 20 of Spain’s 65 most important towns and cities, and only one of the major
      urban centres, Málaga.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister no longer controls the Spanish
      capital or any of the major towns and cities in the north-east of the country
      or on the eastern coast, all the way down to the ancient port city of Cartagena,
      where a regionalist party is now in charge of city hall and where the new mayor
      has already said the city should have its own new province. Ms. Colau and Mr.
      Mas have already met in Barcelona and agreed to ask Madrid together for the
      “right to decide” and in Vitoria, the new Basque Nationalist Party mayor wasted
      no time in ordering the Spanish flag removed from city hall.\r\n\r\nAfter all
      of the empty rhetoric and promises of “change”, the ultimate empty signifier
      has begun to take on some meaning and the most significant part of that meaning
      for left-wing and nationalist forces in Spain today is, in the end: “anyone
      but the PP”.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish right, which after Podemos’s surprise entrance
      into real politics at the European elections last year reacted with fear and
      outrage, has this week reached a new level of apoplexy. This time, both the
      Popular Party as an organisation and the Prime Minister himself have joined
      in. The PP issued a ferocious statement on Friday vilifying the PSOE and blasting
      its “irresponsible” leader Pedro Sánchez for doing the deals after appearing
      at the beginning of 2015 to have been such a statesmanlike and responsible politician,
      signing a joint anti-terror agreement with Mr. Rajoy in Moncloa. The Prime Minister
      took to Twitter on Saturday evening to express his frustration at the “eccentric”
      and “sectarian” deals.\r\n\r\nAll of this has huge implications for the general
      election set to take place in the autumn, given that local elections in Spain
      generally forecast the result of the national ballot a few months later. Even
      if no party wins an overall majority, as the polls suggest, if the new Popular
      Fronts are capable of doing deals at the local level across the country to oust
      the PP, they will very likely be able to do a similar deal after the general
      election to attempt to govern Spain."

    - Spanish Air Traffic Controllers' Non-Strike Strike
    - Courts have ruled there was no plan by air traffic controllers to close Spanish
      airspace in 2010.
    - "Eurocontrol reported 0% delays due to industrial action by Spanish air traffic
      controllers after two days of partial stoppages, with two more days (Friday,
      Sunday) still to go. The minimum services agreed upon by the Ministry of Public
      Works and ENAIRE, the public company responsible for air traffic control in
      Spanish skies, were 70% of normal levels, but that figure has been interpreted
      in such a way as to affect 70% of scheduled staffing levels, not 70% of service
      provisions, leading to the 0% delay figure at Eurocontrol and the Minister of
      Public Works, Ana Pastor, announcing triumphantly on Monday night, after the
      first day of stoppages, that between 98% and 100% of flights were on time.\r\n\r\nThat
      way of doing things, said air traffic controllers union USCA on Wednesday, is
      \"abusive\", going as far as to say it was a violation of the right to strike.
      Their communications secretary, Susana Romero, told The Spain Report that, despite
      the lack of effect of their industrial action on flight operations, controllers
      would be responsible and no additional actions or changes of strike plans were
      being prepared for the last two days of stoppages: \"we are going to comply
      with the law\", she said: \"we have no other choice\".\r\n\r\nThe reasons for
      the strike stretch back to 2010. ENAIRE has sanctioned 61 controllers in Barcelona
      with the loss of pay and employment for one month for their role in air traffic
      chaos that took place in December of that year—during which the Spanish government
      declared a state of alarm and militarised air traffic control until January.
      The government maintained there had been a \"wildcat strike\" by air traffic
      controllers who had planned to close Spanish airspace during the longest bank
      holiday weekend of the year. The controllers said it was about the mismanagement
      of new working hours legislation and that the government had invented the wildcat
      strike excuse to justify the militarisation of air traffic control to the Spanish
      public. Militarising air traffic control meant the working hours legislation
      was no longer applicable. During the chaos, there was a serious near miss between
      a helicopter and an Iberia jet.\r\n\r\nUSCA also wants Marco Antonio Enríquez,
      a controller in Santiago de Compostela (Galicia), reinstated. He was the first
      controller in Galicia to warn AENA—the public body then responsible for Spanish
      skies—that he was coming up against the new working hours limit.\r\n\r\n21 courts
      across the country have since sided with the controllers, closing cases and
      ruling there was no secret plan to close Spanish airspace. The court in Barcelona
      that closed the case against the 61 controllers in that city in January this
      year had also petitioned the Supreme Court to bring together the cases in Madrid
      and Barcelona, a request the Supreme Court rejected, arguing \"there was no
      joint concerted actions by controllers\" and ruling that any such conclusion
      was \"adventurous and lacking in evidence\". An expert psychologist's report
      prepared for the air traffic controllers' defence team concluded it was impossible
      for the controllers to have acted in a \"concerted, deliberate and prepared\"
      manner, and qualified the actions of AENA as \"erratic and disconcerting\".\r\n\r\nSpeaking
      to The Spain Report today, ENAIRE continued to justify the sanctions imposed
      on the 61 controllers in Barcelona \"given their role in the events of 2010\",
      and insisted civil employment sanctions were separate from any criminal cases
      closed by judges, but was unable to provide any further explanation of a more
      direct connection between the 61 and the events in 2010, or say why the Barcelona
      controllers were to be sanctioned when hundreds of others across Spain, also
      working over that period, will not be.\r\n\r\nGiven the weight of judicial rulings
      rejecting any collaborative plan by Spanish controllers, ENAIRE either needs
      to provide much more convincing proof of its reasons for sanctioning the Barcelona
      controllers and for refusing to readmit Mr. Enríquez, or withdraw the sanctions
      and give him his job back."

    - PP Struggles With Election Rout As Left Surges
    - Aguirre vows to "stop Podemos" at all costs; four regional first ministers to
      step down.
    - "Senior members of the governing Popular Party began to react in different ways
      on Tuesday following the election results on Sunday night and Mariano Rajoy's
      stubborn defence on Monday of his party's 'victory', which saw them lose their
      overall majorities in all but one tiny Spanish region (Ceuta) and major cities
      across the country, despite receiving the highest number of votes.\r\n\r\nFour
      regional Popular Party First Ministers—Alberto Fabra in Valencia, Juan Vicente
      Herrera in Castilla y León, José Ramón Bauzá in the Balearic Islands and Luisa
      Fernanda Rudi in Aragón—announced that they would be stepping down as regional
      PP chairmen and women, although not immediately. Mr. Herrera—in a country where
      loyalty upwards towards the boss is normally much more important than pleasing
      voters—slammed the Prime Minister on a radio programme this morning, suggesting
      he should take \"a long look in the mirror at himself\".\r\n\r\nDuring the course
      of the day, it became clearer the three main opposition parties seemed more
      in the mood for anti-PP coalitions than maintaining any sense of establishment
      \"stability\". It was reported Pedro Sánchez (PSOE) and Pablo Iglesias (Podemos)
      had sent each other some first messages via WhatsApp, and that Mr. Sánchez had
      actually spoken on the phone to Albert Rivera (Ciudadanos). The PSOE in Murcia
      announced it was to begin negotiations with both Podemos and Ciudadanos, in
      an attempt to oust the PP in that region after 20 years in power. \r\n\r\nThe
      most commented episode of the day, though, was Esperanza Aguirre's press conference
      in Madrid, where the PP won 21 councillors, eight short of a 29 seat majority
      in City Hall. True to form, Mrs. Aguirre came out blazing, with jabs against
      both Mr. Rajoy's lack of self criticism—although she stopped short of calling
      on the Prime Minister to resign—and, most of all, against the Ahora Madrid (Podemos)
      candidate, Manuela Carmena. \r\n\r\nHer new political aim, she said, was now
      to \"stop Podemos\" at all costs, and to that end she herself was willing to
      give up the chance of becoming mayor, instead allowing Antonio Miguel Carmona
      (PSOE) to take the top job in the Spanish capital as part of a \"centrist\"
      coalition in which—using her definitions—the PSOE would represent the centre
      left, Ciudadanos the centre centre and the PP the centre right.\r\n\r\nSuch
      a coalition would group together \"a million Madrid voters\", said Mrs. Aguirre.
      Mrs. Carmena, in sharp contrast, led the other 30%, the \"radical left\". The
      point of the centrist coalition would be \"to stop Podemos using Madrid City
      Hall as a trampoline to win the general election in November\". Mrs. Aguirre
      even went so far in her attack as to say that the Podemos option in Madrid,
      called Ahora Madrid: \"is a different political force that is not in our democratic
      constitutional system\".\r\n\r\nThe other candidates took to Twitter during
      her press conference with their replies. Mr. Carmona was first, rejecting her
      offer before she had finished speaking: \"To Aguirre's proposal of Ciudadanos
      or PSOE receiving her votes, my reply, on behalf of the PSOE and myself, was
      absolutely NOT\". The official PSOE account joined in, saying \"we've even told
      her in Chinese, over the past few months. We will NOT do a deal with the PP\".\r\n\r\nAhora
      Madrid tweeted that they were \"so much a part of the democratic system\" that
      519,210 Madrid residents had voted for them, awarding them 20 seats, just one
      short of Mrs. Aguirre's own 21. \"Onwards\", they concluded. Mrs. Carmena replied
      that: \"I have only been outside of the democratic system when it didn't exist,
      and I fought for it. Let's be serious, please, Madrid needs it\".\r\n\r\nSpanish
      journalists took delight in digging up quotes from last week (Mr. Carmona \"madly\"
      wanted to win power) and last year (\"this PSOE is a problem for Spain, an element
      of instability\") that demonstrated how quickly Mrs. Aguirre was capable of
      changing her tune.\r\n\r\nCiudadanos Madrid and their candidate, Begoña Villacís,
      were more reserved in their replies, saying they had not yet met any of the
      the other parties and that they believed in \"negotiation based on good government,
      transparency and regeneration\".\r\n\r\nLooking at the parliamentary and city
      hall calendars, we will not see any of the new regional governments or mayors
      for a few weeks yet—whomever they end up being—but if these are the results
      just two days after the elections, the PP will have to come up with a new, more
      coherent plan quickly if it wants to hold on to some power and avoid a long
      summer of anti-PP manoeuvring and media attention in the run up to the general
      election in the autumn."

    - Popular Party Punished, Confusing Coalitions Coming
    - Are Spaniards ready for all the Byzantine horse trading before the general election?
    - "The Popular Party (PP) lost a lot of political power in the local and regional
      elections on Sunday night in Spain, compared to 2011: 2.4 million votes and
      3,757 councillors in the local elections, 128 seats in the different regional
      parliaments, and the overall majorities it had enjoyed in regional assemblies
      and regional capitals across the country. It held on to its overall majority
      in just one region, the Spanish North African city of Ceuta. It almost reached
      an overall majority in the two Castillas (Castilla y León and Castilla La Mancha),
      returning just one seat short in each area. Its share of the vote plummeted
      to 27% in the local elections, compared to 38% in the previous local elections
      or 44% at the last general election.\r\n\r\nThe important point is not just
      what it means for the PP but that strong majority government is no longer possible
      in the Spanish regions, which had a total budget spend of €164 billion in 2014.
      Coalitions will be needed in every region, with one tiny exception, and in every
      regional capital. The question now is who will do deals with whom and which
      principles will be traded off against the opportunity of real power, as the
      narrative focus shifts straight to the implications for the general election
      later in the year. If the obstinate lack of horse trading in Andalusia since
      March is anything to go by, the country might now face weeks or months of interim
      regional and municipal government, as parties refuse to budge on one issue or
      another.\r\n\r\nThe PSOE lost over half a million votes and 942 councillors
      in the local elections, as well as 25 seats in regional parliaments. United
      Left (IU) also lost 25 regional assembly seats and 382,000 local votes. Union,
      Progress &amp; Democracy (UPyD) is in meltdown: Rosa Diez has announced she
      will not run for leader again and this morning one MP tweeted his resignation
      from both parliament and the party. Ciudadanos scooped up 1.4 million local
      votes, 1,500 councillors and 61 regional MPs but, compared to pre-election polling
      forecasts following its meteoric rise since January, Albert Rivera's party under
      performed: \"Ciudadanos did not live up to expectations\", read the reprimand
      on the front page of La Razón.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear Ciudadanos will be enough
      to help the PP continue to govern in most areas or major cities.\r\n\r\nThe
      biggest winner of the night was Podemos, or the Podemos-like options in towns
      and cities around the country. The complexity of the results in 8,122 municipalities
      multiplied by all the different local Podemos options (Let's Win X, We Are X,
      X In Common, Participate X, Now Is X, Let's Change X, etc.) preclude a precise
      tally for now but the major victories in Barcelona (Ada Colau, Barcelona en
      Comú) and Madrid (Manuela Carmena, Ahora Madrid)—the two largest cities in Spain—are
      indicative enough of what has happened; the Podemos options won around 100 seats
      in total on the councils of major Spanish regional capitals, and in the regional
      parliaments, Podemos picked up 119 seats, twice as many as Ciudadanos.\r\n\r\nAll
      of which means there is a very real prospect, notwithstanding any national agreements,
      of a series of more-left-than-centre 'popular fronts' springing up across the
      country in the run up to the general election.\r\n\r\n12 months ago, the Spanish
      right <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/7601/podemos-are-weirdo-rancid-commies-or-hitler/\">reacted</a>
      with horror when Podemos won five seats in the European Parliament. \"Rancid,
      authoritarian communism\", \"Ponytail Boy\", \"another type of weirdo\", \"media-hyped
      commie\", \"the most fiercely anti-Spanish forces\", \"radical nationalism,
      friends of terrorists\", \"Maduro's Venezuela, \"Castro's Cuba\" and, yes, \"Hitler
      won the elections in Germany by taking advantage of general discontent\". It
      was, concluded Libertad Digital, \"a nightmare situation\".\r\n\r\nLast night,
      the same Spanish right reacted with a similar mixture of outrage and despair,
      equal to the joy and hope expressed by progressives. \"Instability\" was the
      giant headline on the front page of La Razón, one of whose columnists suggested
      The Guardian's correspondent must be suffering from alcohol poisoning; \"Barcelona
      and Madrid in the hands of the radical left\", headlined El Mundo on its front
      page. In an editorial titled \"Spaniards have had enough of Rajoy\", Libertad
      Digital this time concluded the outlook was now \"black\" for the Spanish right,
      and forecast \"a definitive debacle\" at the general election later in the year:
      \"that will not only finish the PP off […] but, worse, will leave Spain in the
      hands of a popular front captained by the extreme left that will, like in 1982,
      occupy power for decades\".\r\n\r\nEl País has projected the results of the
      local and regional elections onto a hypothetical general election and, were
      the outcome to be similar, it would suggest the bipartisan system is very far
      from dead in Spain, despite recent polls. Some kind of coalition government
      would be necessary, but with Podemos and Ciudadanos very much as junior partners
      to the larger PP or PSOE blocks; that is fantasy for now. Pablo Iglesias tweeted
      that he is ready to face the \"challenge\" of winning the general election \"with
      joy\". There has been some talk recently of Mr. Rajoy considering an early general
      election, in September instead of December, but it is too early to tell how
      last night's results might affect his calculation. The narrative in the months
      ahead of us will in any case be focused on the collapse of the Popular Party
      and the invigorating proposals and policies offered up by the newcomers, many
      of which are far from the monotonous tale of 'economic recovery' the PP has
      been selling the country since last year.\r\n\r\nCollectively, Spaniards have
      voted for coalitions and confusion, not clarity and unity. Similar periods of
      political effervescence in previous decades and centuries have consistently
      produced exciting results."

    - A Foggy Final Approach To The May Elections
    - Month of mud slinging on corruption and integrity not reflected in final pre-election
      polls.
    - "After the shambles of the polls and election forecasting in the British general
      election ten days ago, in which none of the major survey companies got the result
      of the ballot right, it might be foolhardy to attempt a certain prediction in
      Spain, but at the last Spanish election, the Andalusian regional vote on March
      22, the pollsters here were spot on. Maybe it is the polling method, maybe it
      is the vagaries of each electoral system combined with the polling method or
      maybe, as some commentators have suggested, there were hundreds of thousands
      of voters who just lied to the pollsters. The Popular Party (PP) reacted with
      almost child-like excitement at the news, leaping to the conclusion that the
      same thing would happen in Spain and benefit Mr. Rajoy.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron's
      strategy chiefs Lynton Crosby and Jim Messina told <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/11608648/Lynton-Crosby-Betrayal-of-British-voters.html\">The
      Telegraph</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/tories-knew-they-would-win-three-weeks-before-election-jim-messina/story-fnb64oi6-1227353971040\">The
      Australian</a> and <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9528372/how-did-the-polls-get-it-so-wrong-jim-messina-knows/\">The
      Spectator</a> that politicos and columnists need to get out in the real world
      a bit more and listen to voters. After unemployment, which has been Spaniards
      main worry for the whole parliament under Mr. Rajoy, and the previous one under
      Mr. Zapatero, corruption has risen to a strong second place over the past two
      years and continues at near-record levels. The stream of corruption stories
      over the past six months especially has been incessant. We are also observing
      how corruption and integrity are the main rhetorical sticking point in the negotiations
      in Andalusia, still without a new government two months after their regional
      vote.\r\n\r\nSusana Díaz has tried three times and failed three times to win
      the confidence of the regional parliament and the vote has not budged: 47 PSOE
      'yes' votes in favour against the 62 'no' votes from all of the other parties.
      The battle in the south is taking place with an eye on next week's local and
      regional elections and the general election later in the year. None of the other
      parties want to be seen to be caving in this early on. Political brand values
      and voter mindshare are at stake.\r\n\r\nThree former Andalusian first ministers,
      currently serving as senators or MPs in Madrid, are on the hook in fraud investigations
      stretching back years, in a region where the socialists have ruled for more
      than three decades. The other parties want them out before any abstention or
      deal can be reached to allow Mrs. Diaz to govern. The Civil Guard continues
      to publish updates on the total amount swindled in the giant unemployment fraud
      case in the south: their latest figure is €1.3 billion. And just last week,
      another new scandal broke, this time involving the awarding by the regional
      government of a new mine contract—just eight days before the regional elections
      took place—in a place called Aznalcóllar. A judge looking at the adjudication
      has said the whole thing needs revising. The regional Popular Party immediately
      suspended its talks with Mrs. Diaz.\r\n\r\nNext door in Murcia, most of the
      opposition parties—except, notably, Ciudadanos—have signed pre-electoral agreements
      that leave the PP—in regional government for the last 20 years—out in the cold.
      Again, the major rhetorical sticking point is corruption and political integrity.
      If polls are to be believed, the Popular Party is set to lose a lot of support,
      but not catastrophically so, meaning coalitions or minority government beckon.
      On the ground in Murcia, Podemos has managed to organise the largest, most enthusiastic
      rally of the campaign.\r\n\r\nEl País, with reference to the latest CIS survey
      data, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/05/15/media/1431718064_098936.html\">reported</a>
      a similar situation across the country. By April, the PP was only set to hold
      on to the northern region of Castilla y León with a majority. Yesterday, the
      same newspaper published two shock Metroscopia polls suggesting the Podemos
      options in Madrid (Ahora Madrid) and Barcelona (Barcelona en Comú) might win
      City Hall in each capital. Cadena SER reported this morning the PSOE might draw
      with the PP in Seville, which would be a huge loss for Mr. Rajoy's party compared
      to 2011.\r\n\r\nThere are 67, 640 council seats, 8,122 town halls and 15 regional
      governments (out of 19) up for grabs.\r\n\r\nToday is the last day polls may
      be published in Spain before the elections, which means there will be almost
      a whole week of unmeasured campaigning before the vote takes place, almost as
      if, at the end of a long and entertaining flight, our aircraft suddenly entered
      a bank of thick fog while on final approach to the airport. The field work for
      the CIS, which is the major reference survey in Spain, was done in April before
      this last long month of new scandals and mud slinging began, all of which, in
      theory, affects the core issue of corruption and integrity. Added to the unexpected
      rise of Ciudadanos since January and the novelty of Podemos—it only won its
      European Parliament seats a year ago—the results next Sunday night could surprise
      Spain and the world."

    - Is Spain Ready For Jihadi Terror On The Costas?
    - What would an Islamic State jihadi killing spree do to the national psyche and
      the economy?
    - "Another 11 jihadi suspects were arrested in Spain on Wednesday morning, again
      in several towns in Catalonia, including the regional capital Barcelona, where
      Mr. Espadaler said the group was fully operational and ready to attack, searching
      for new recruits to fight with the Islamic State. The police think they managed
      to do so successfully on at least one occasion. Five of those arrested were
      native Spaniards—recent converts to radical Islam—and they had been taking photos
      of emblematic buildings in Barcelona. The Spanish Home Secretary, Mr. Fernández
      Díaz, said on Catalan radio this morning that half of the more radical Salafist
      mosques in Spain are to be found in the north-eastern region, as is approximately
      a third of Spain's Muslim population.\r\n\r\nNext Monday, Spain will host a
      multilateral summit, in Barcelona, on how Mediterranean countries can combat Islamic
      extremism.\r\n\r\nThe terror threat alert in Spain has officially been at three,
      out of a total of five levels, since the raid on Charlie Hebdo in Paris at the
      beginning of January, although some strategic high-risk targets have been on
      maximum alert. Around 30 people have been arrested in different Spanish towns
      for belonging to some kind of Islamic terror group since then. Two Spaniards,
      Catalan residents, were killed in the jihadi assault on the Bardo museum in
      Tunis on March 18. Attending the march against terrorism in the Tunisian capital,
      the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr. García Margallo, said: \"we are facing a global
      threat, probably the gravest we have faced\" since the Second World War.\r\n\r\nSpain
      is no stranger to terrorist attacks, or to radical islamic horror. The Madrid
      train bombings in March 2004, the largest terror event on European soil after
      the Lockerbie bombing in 1988, killed 191 and injured almost 2,000. Beyond the
      immediate carnage and destruction, the effect they had on the national psyche
      and political debate was extremely corrosive. In contrast to other nations'
      reactions, many Spaniards were not united but driven further apart. The bombings,
      and the lies and deceit that followed in their aftermath, reversed the expected
      outcome of that year's general election, led to Spain's withdrawal from Iraq,
      and caused years of acrimonious conspiracy theories, which some commentators
      argue still remain unresolved.\r\n\r\nAl Qaeda's methods, though, were not those
      of the Islamic State today.\r\n\r\nAl-Andalus, historical moorish Spain—the
      most extended version of which covered three-quarters or more of the Iberian
      Peninsula—has been on the radical Islamic wish list for years. Whereas Al Qaeda
      went for what terror experts sometimes label 'spectaculars'—big coordinated
      strikes on things like aircraft, large buildings and train systems (New York,
      Madrid, London)—Islamic State jihadis are more sadistic, more basic and more
      territorial, favouring the commando-style urban terror tactics first seen during
      the onslaught on Mumbai in India and then again in the operation against the
      Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya. This year's attacks in Paris and Tunis,
      and the one on the coffee shop in Sydney in December, all followed that model.\r\n\r\nThey
      have no need for rucksack bombs or to smuggle plastic explosives or dynamite
      in to the country or out of a mine, no complex improvised explosive devices
      that need the skill of a master bomb maker to assemble. Just some automatic
      weapons, a few thousand rounds of ammunition, perhaps some grenades and a willingness
      to seek martyrdom after slaughtering as many innocent bystanders as they can
      take with them in the meantime. They are less restrained even than Al Qaeda
      and more concerned with attacking cultural, tourist, historical and religious
      targets than transport systems.\r\n\r\nSpain is chock full of tourists, history,
      culture and Catholicism. Ranking third on the list of countries with the most
      UNESCO world heritage sites, 60.7 million tourists visited the country in 2014,
      spending about €49 billion, or nearly 5% of Spanish GDP. After the attack on
      the Bardo Museum in Tunis, cruise companies and tour operators waited less than
      24 hours before pulling out and beginning to organise alternate Easter destinations
      for hundreds of thousands of their customers around the Mediterranean. Spain,
      already a frequent port of call on cruise itineraries, was among the leading
      benefactors. No one wants their gentle morning shore excursion to a place of
      peace, culture, history and relaxation to be ripped apart by sudden, vicious,
      violent jihadi terror that fills the air with loud bangs, zinging bullets, panic,
      screams, blood, destruction and death.\r\n\r\nFrom the radical Islamic terror
      perspective, Spain must seem like a target-rich environment.\r\n\r\nIs Spain
      ready for the shock of jihadis on the costas or in its major tourist cities?
      Spanish security forces have been on the ball since January, pro-actively arresting
      those whom they suspect formed part of an Islamic State cell but French, Australian
      and Tunisian security services were no less aware of the threat, and they couldn't
      stop the plots in their countries. Spain is again living through a major election
      year, and set for even bigger tourist numbers this year than last. What would
      a distributed Islamic State urban terror blitz on key tourist and cultural targets,
      perhaps in more than one city at the same time, live tweeted and broadcast around
      the world as it unfolded, do to the national psyche this time? There are no
      big foreign wars for Spain to withdraw from in 2015 but given the vital importance
      of tourism for Brand Spain, how big a hole would an attack blow in the nation's
      economic recovery?"

    - Europe Should Act At Once To Allay Passenger Fears
    - Solid reporting by local media and the New York Times and a transparent press
      conference by the Marseille prosecutor mean Europe can act now to increase air
      safety.
    - "For any survivors and the grieving relatives, psychologists say one of the
      most important factors in eventual recovery from such a huge trauma or loss
      is the existence of a coherent, realistic narrative about what happened to them
      or their loved ones: what went wrong, who was involved and what can we do to
      stop it happening again? Citizens of the countries involved and millions of
      air passengers around the continent also have a right to those answers. Spanish
      government departments spent two days saying not very much at all outside of
      the official script, especially regarding the nationalities of those killed:
      \"no comment\" or \"we are not talking about that\"—not \"we don't have the
      information\"—was the most frequent reply.\r\n\r\nLocal media around Europe
      provided the first reports of who the victims were. In Spain, La Verdad told
      us of victims from Murcia, El Periódico and La Vanguardia about those from Catalonia
      and El Heraldo about the dead from Aragón. To The Spain Report's knowledge,
      none of those accounts have been disproven and all were complied by reporters
      talking to family, friends, colleagues and local officials, distraught at the
      near certain knowledge their husband, wife, friend or co-worker had been on
      the Germanwings plane.\r\n\r\nAfter two days without any kind of official passenger
      list to go on, and with the remains of the aircraft and 150 corpses still strewn
      across a French mountainside, ordinary Europeans yesterday got some answers,
      and rather more quickly than is normal in such accidents, thanks to world-class
      reporting by the New York Times and an extraordinary—and an extraordinarily
      transparent—press conference by the Marseille public prosecutor, from which
      Spanish authorities could learn a lot. The American newspaper broke the story
      that one of the pilots had been unable to reenter the cockpit and Mr. Robin
      confirmed that version hours later: the copilot had locked the captain out and
      flown the A320 into the Alps.\r\n\r\nLufthansa's CEO Carsten Spohr said: \"If
      a person kills himself and also 149 other people, another word should be used
      -- not suicide\".\r\n\r\nIn Spain, Heraldo scooped Mr. Robin by half-an-hour
      after speaking to Aragonese relatives who were present at the prosecutor's briefing
      to family members shortly before the press conference began.\r\n\r\nMillions now
      know that it is not mandatory for European airlines to ensure two people are
      always present in the cockpits of the planes they are flying in as passengers.
      It has been left up to each airline to decide for themselves how they wish to
      tackle the problem, and this is not the first time a commercial airline pilot
      has flown his aircraft into the ground. It happened on Egypt Air Flight 990
      and Mozambique Airlines Flight 470. It is a leading theory for what happened
      to Malaysian Airlines MH370 last year. The current system and existing regulations
      are evidently not fit-for-purpose.\r\n\r\nSome airlines, such as Ryanair or
      Air Lingus, say they have had a two-person policy in place for some time. In
      Spain, Vueling told this newspaper they too used a two-person rule when pilots
      left the cockpit. A second group of airlines rushed straight out in front of
      the obvious fears in the minds of millions of anxious customers: Norwegian,
      EasyJet, Air Canda and Icelandair announced they would be implementing a two-person
      rule in their cockpits immediately. A third group, including Spanish airlines
      Iberia, Air Europa, Swiftair and IAG—the group that owns Iberia, Vueling and
      British Airways—refused to comment on their policy at all, which given the circumstances
      can only suggest they do not currently use such a procedure.\r\n\r\nEuropean
      air safety authorities should now immediately order a two-person rule for the
      cockpits of all airliners flying into or out of Europe, and for all European
      carriers. Within the range of changes ordered after accidents by aviation authorities,
      this one does not seem to be particularly expensive or cumbersome, requiring
      not much more than a change in existing crew procedures, and many airlines already
      do it. It has been policy in the United States for some time. If airline or
      pilots' lobbies obstruct the move, or European bureaucracy is wheeled out as
      an excuse for a slow response, national governments must take the lead and order
      the change in their own countries.\r\n\r\nSafety in European skies and the peace
      of mind of millions of people who fly safely from one end of the continent to
      the other demand it."

    - 'A Corrupt Governing Party: Rajoy Will Not Resign'
    - Judge Ruz's astonishing new ruling describing long-term, systemic, endemic corruption
      in Spain's governing Popular Party will likely have no direct political impact
      before the elections.
    - "Investigating judge Pablo Ruz yesterday published a new 190-page ruling with
      \"solid, well-founded indications\" of how the governing Popular Party was really
      financed between 1990 and 2008. In that 18-year period, he said, Mr. Rajoy's
      party used a series of secret slush funds—\"removed from the legal economic
      circuit\"—around the country to pay for election campaigns and other party business,
      including the €1.6 million refurbishment of national party headquarters in the
      Calle Génova in central Madrid.\r\n\r\nThere is now sufficient proof, says Judge
      Ruz, that there was: \"a financing system for the Popular Party organised via
      private sources that, in a systematic manner, between the years 1990 and 2008,
      breached the limits, requirements and conditions laid down by the law; and the
      national party manager—the suspect Luis Bárcenas Gutiérrez—was in charge of
      this, along with the treasurer of the party—the suspect Álvaro de Lapuerta Quintero—from
      1993 to 2008, when Luis Bárcenas took over in the post.\"\r\n\r\nThe monies
      were not accounted for in the proper way and tax was not paid on the income.\r\n\r\nThe
      national election campaigns in 2004 and 2008, both with now Prime Minister Mariano
      Rajoy as the then PP candidate against Mr. Zapatero, received funding from the
      off-the-books accounts, as did the Andalusian election campaigns in the same
      years, the European election campaign in 2004 and the Catalan election campaign
      in 2003. Mr. Bárcenas, says the judge, also used some of the money to finance
      his own election campaign as a senator for Cantabria. €1.17 million in total.\r\n\r\nThe
      big money was provided by some of the biggest construction tycoons in Spain,
      who appear in the Bárcenas Papers—the handwritten accounting notes whose appearance
      marked the beginning of the scandal two years ago—and in the judge's ruling,
      but charges against 22 of the businessmen initially suspected of providing the
      funds have been dropped given the lack of evidence linking donations attributed
      to them to the awarding of public works contracts.\r\n\r\nTwo former PP treasurers
      and a former manager are to be tried on charges of misappropriation of funds.
      The architect, directors and one employee of Unifica, the architect's firm that
      refurbished the party headquarters building in Madrid between 2005 and 2010,
      will also stand trial. The Popular Party will go to court for \"subsidiary civil
      liability\".\r\n\r\nThe Popular Party issued a five-point rebuttal last night
      arguing that the party had never known about any off-the-books accounting; that
      the party does not share the judge's theory that it must pay corporation tax
      on \"donations the PP was not aware of\"; that political donations have always
      been extent from corporation tax; that corporation tax anyway allows for cost
      deductions; and that the Popular Party reserves the right to defend itself in
      court.\r\n\r\nThe judge has not found legal proof that Mariano Rajoy was criminally
      involved in or linked to the scheme. Politically, though, is it believable that
      Mr. Rajoy, then already leader of the Popular Party, and before him José María
      Aznar, knew nothing of what was, according to the judge's ruling, common practice
      in their party? Try, if you will, to imagine the same ruling being published
      in the United States or the United Kingdom, and the political earthquake it
      would unleash in both countries.\r\n\r\nPolitical accountability in matters
      of corruption in Spain is extremely rare. Drawing blood from a stone is an easier
      task. Do not expect the Prime Minister to resign, do not expect the Popular
      Party to crumble and do not expect early elections to be called."

    - PSOE Wins In Andalusia, Podemos Could Win Spain
    - 33 years of PSOE government in Andalusia will now become 37. The success of
      Spanish polling data means Podemos has a chance at government in the general
      election.
    - "After 33 years of Socialist Party government in Andalusia, with a 34% unemployment
      rate and with three former PSOE First Ministers about to testify as suspects
      in a billion euro fraud case, voters in the southern Spanish region have just
      said they want more of the same. The PSOE has lost not a single seat, although
      due to the technicalities of the Spanish electoral system, it has kept them
      with 120,000 fewer votes. First Minister Susana Díez told Cadena SER radio station
      shortly after 11 p.m. on Sunday that: \"Andalusians have chosen freely to allow
      the Spanish Socialist Party to accompany them on their path forward\".\r\n\r\nPodemos
      and Ciudadanos are also to be congratulated, having participated for the first
      time in elections in the region. They both won very relevant numbers of seats,
      15 in the case of Podemos and 9 in the case of Ciudadanos. Finally, praise is
      due for Spanish pollsters and political analysts: the results tonight were squarely
      within the parameters of the latest polling data.\r\n\r\nThis ballot has been
      a disaster, though, for the Popular Party (PP), which came second but lost 17
      seats compared to 2012; for United Left (IU), which dropped from 12 seats to
      five; and for Union, Progress & Democracy (UPyD) which, while still not winning
      any seats at all, saw its share of the vote drop by 40%. This new political
      environment leaves Mrs. Díaz with a range of coalition options for government.\r\n\r\nThe
      bipartisan political model in Spain is not yet dead as some people had eagerly
      anticipated. Wounded, yes, but not even mortally so. Susana Díaz now has three
      coalition options to reach a 55-vote majority to govern, out of a total of 109
      seats in the Andalusian parliament. Given the non-fatal blow to the bipartisan
      model, she could choose a grand establishment coalition with the Popular Party
      (33 seats); she could veer much further left and sign up with Podemos, or due
      to the ideologically divisive nature of either of those options, she could now
      avoid them by negotiating with Ciudadanos. \r\n\r\nThis morning, the Ciudadanos
      candidate ruled out joining the regional government if his party did not win
      the election but a parliamentary support deal could be done—like the one between
      Mr. Mas and Mr. Junqueras in Catalonia—which would not need anybody from Ciudadanos
      to dirty their hands in a PSOE government. On a national level, this would also
      allow the PSOE to avoid being seen to be breaking further left or further right,
      in a context in which ideas on grand coalitions have been used as political
      ammunition since the European elections last May. Mrs. Diaz's solid victory
      in Andalusia tonight must also be worrying for national PSOE Secretary General
      Pedro Sánchez. The Socialist Party has not yet decided who its candidate in
      the general election will be and Mrs. Díaz's name is at the top of most lists.\r\n\r\nLooking
      forward to that general election, which is due at the end of November, there
      is one other startling conclusion to be drawn from tonight's results in Andalusia:
      if Spain's pols continue to be broadly correct, and continue to tell the tale
      they have been entertaining Spaniards with over the past few weeks, then Pablo
      Iglesias might be Prime Minister of Spain by Christmas, at the head of a Podemos
      coalition government. His party has frequently been placed in the lead in national
      polls over the past few months."

    - What Does A Level Four Terror Threat Mean In Spain?
    - The Home Secretary announced he was raising the terror threat level in Spain
      from three to four after the attacks in Tunisia. The Spain Report looked at
      what that means in practice.
    - "The Spanish Home Secretary, Jorge Fernández Díaz, announced on Friday that
      the government was increasing the terror threat level in the country from its
      previous level of three—set after the attacks in Paris in January—to four, out
      of a total of five, following an urgent meeting of a cross-party anti-jihadi
      terror group created in January.\r\n\r\nLevel four means Spanish intelligence
      services believe there is a \"high risk\" of a terror attack occurring in Spain.\r\n\r\nDuring
      his press conference, Mr. Fernández Díaz explained the threat level was being
      raised for three reasons: the geographical proximity of Friday's attacks in
      France and Tunisia, the first anniversary of the Islamic State, and unspecified
      confidential information in the power of Spanish intelligence services.\r\n\r\n\"For
      obvious reasons\", a Home Office spokeswoman told The Spain Report: \"the Home
      Secretary is not going to make that information public\".\r\n\r\nShe added that
      level four meant \"maximum reinforcements\" of Spain's different police forces
      at key infrastructure points and likely targets around the country \"in terms
      of prevention, investigation and infrastructure protection\".\r\n\r\nFollowing
      the declaration of a level three alert in January, police officers could be
      seen patrolling Spanish train stations with long weapons for the first time
      in many years, and the threat level at some key strategic targets, such as some
      embassies, was raised straight to five.\r\n\r\nAt level four, security and vigilance
      at nuclear power stations, electricity generation facilities, water plants,
      chemical plants, train stations and airports will be increased even further,
      and there will be a more visible police presence at sporting events.\r\n\r\nSpaniards
      and tourists will notice an even stronger police presence in Spain's towns and
      cities, on top of the 20,000 extra agents who take part in the annual Safe Tourism
      operation.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond level four?\r\n\r\n\"Level five means calling out
      the Army\", said the spokeswoman. At level four, Spain's Armed Forces are warned
      of the increased threat and alert level, but are not required to actively protect
      key points.\r\n\r\n\"They are absolutely not being called out of their barracks
      at this stage\", she stressed.\r\n\r\nEl País reported that the last time the
      Armed Forces had been called upon to overtly help with a terror threat in Spain,
      protecting train stations and power stations, was after the March 11 train bombings
      in Madrid in 2004.\r\n\r\nOn May 27, Spain adopted a new terror threat level
      system, with alerts stretching from the \"very low\" risk of level one to a
      \"very high\" risk at level five. This is the first time the threat level has
      been changed under the new system.\r\n\r\nSpain also increased its threat level
      to three—under the old system—for the proclamation of King Felipe last June."

    - " 8,122 towns and cities across Spain appointed new mayors on Saturday. This

      purpose of this map is to describe the broad changes in Spanish municipal politics
      following the election of mayors across the country on Saturday, in which 8,122
      towns and cities elected new leaders; a certain simplification is necessary
      to highlight those changes;</li>\r\n\t<li>The map represents the end result
      in the 65 most important cities in Spain, in terms of the largest numbers of
      residents and their administrative importance (regional capitals, provincial
      capitals, etc.);</li>\r\n\t<li>The political colour of each town and city is
      for the new mayor, not the coalition that supported his or her appointment;</li>\r\n\t<li>“Podemos
      Parties” include all of the different platforms in which Podemos has participated
      or that Podemos has supported;</li>\r\n\t<li>The nationalist/regionalist options
      have different priorities in each area, but their defining feature within the
      Spanish context is that nationalism or regionalism;</li>\r\n\t<li>Deeper explanations
      of the different Podemos and nationalist/regionalist options and their subtleties
      will be provided in future articles;</li>\r\n\t<li>Melilla in North Africa is
      not holding its vote today;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>10 Big Shifts In Local Power
      In The New Spain</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Podemos parties have taken the two largest
      cities in Spain, Madrid and Barcelona, with a total of 4.8 million residents;</li>\r\n\t<li>In
      terms of the number of residents each major option now controls, the Podemos
      parties are in the lead and driving change. They control the Spanish capital,
      Madrid, as well as Barcelona, Zaragoza, Badalona, Cádiz, Santiago de Compostela
      and A Coruña, a total of 5.9 million residents, according to the latest census
      data from the National Statistics Institute;</li>\r\n\t<li>The Popular Party
      has only held on to one of Spain’s seven largest cities, Málaga (Andalusia).
      The two largest, Madrid and Barcelona, went to Podemos parties, as did Zaragoza.
      Valencia is now led by Compromís, a Valencian nationalist party, and Seville,
      the largest city in Andalusia, is now controlled by the Spanish Socialist Party
      (PSOE);</li>\r\n\t<li>A slightly arcing, almost straight line can now be drawn
      from Bilbao past Zaragoza all the way down to the south-eastern port city of
      Cartagena, (Murcia). North and east of that line—in the Basque Country, Navarra,
      Catalonia, Valencia and almost all of Aragón—Mariano Rajoy’s governing Popular
      Party does not control any major cities or large towns. The exception is the
      town of Teruel, in Aragón;</li>\r\n\t<li>Spain’s regional extremities, from
      the Basque Country in the north, Catalonia in the north-east, Valencia in the
      east, Andalusia in the south-west, the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands
      and up to Galicia in the north-west, have become more socialist, more left-wing
      and more nationalist or regionalist. The new mayor of Cartagena (Murcia), from
      a party called Movimiento Ciudadano—whose political ideology is described by
      Wikipedia as “Cartagenerism”—has already said he wants Cartagena to have its
      own province;</li>\r\n\t<li>The most populated region in Spain, Andalusia, with
      8.4 million residents, is split in two: the cities in the eastern half (Jaén,
      Granda, Almería and Málaga) are still controlled by the Popular Party; the cities
      in the western half (Córdoba, Seville, Jérez, Cádiz and Huelva) are controlled
      by the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) or Podemos;</li>\r\n\t<li>As senior Podemos
      leader Pablo Echenique has pointed out on Twitter today, it is now possible
      to leap-frog from the French border all the way down to the beach in Cádiz on
      the south-western Atlantic coast of Andalusia without passing through any major
      towns or cities controlled by the Popular Party, which is effectively contained
      within two major pockets in the south-east and the north;</li>\r\n\t<li>United
      Left (IU) controls just one town, Zamora, in Castilla y León, near the Portuguese
      border;</li>\r\n\t<li>Of the nationalist or regionalist parties, Compromís in
      Valencia and the Basque Nationalist Party in Bilbao, San Sebastián and Vitoria
      are now responsible for the most residents, just under 800,000 each;</li>\r\n\t<li>In
      Pamplona, in Navarra, a four-way coalition has given the city to EH Bildu, the
      Basque nationalist party other parties in Spain most closely associate with
      Basque terror group ETA;</li>\r\n</ol>"

    - Opposition Parties In Murcia Want To Kick The PP Out Of Government For The First
      Time Since 1995
    - The  Spain Report spoke to five of the six candidates and attended the major
      events before and during the election campaign.
    - "The Popular Party has governed Murcia for the last 20 years, since before Aznar.
      If the results turn out to be in line with the latest CEMOP poll on Sunday,
      the PP would continue to be the party with the most votes, with some 35% of
      the vote and between 18 and 20 seats in the Regional Assembly, but far from their
      current 33 seats and three to five short of the 23 needed for a majority (in
      a parliament of 45).\r\n\r\nCiudadanos and the PSOE would draw for second place,
      with 21% of the estimated vote and 11 seats each, and Podemos would break in
      with 14% of the vote and five seats. United Left would lose its only regional
      MP and UPyD would go from zero seats to a quarter of zero seats, falling from
      4.5% in 2011 to 1.1% this year.\r\n\r\nIf the results follow the poll because,
      with six main parties fighting for each vote, it is difficult to tally polls
      with rallies, narratives, manifestos, candidates and, above all, real voters,
      most of who live very far from the media and political circus that surrounds
      an election campaign.\r\n<h3>National Brand Values Matter</h3>\r\nIf you ask
      them, most Murcians don't know the names of the regional or local candidates
      of minority or new parties. The national brand is what counts. Several hundred,
      or even a few thousand, queued to watch Pablo Iglesias; the party faithful hurried
      round Rajoy to take selfies with him; and UPyD members got nervous when Rosa
      Díez came to town; they gave her a pink rose.\r\n\r\n\"Of course\", UPyD's national
      brand is prejudicial, says Encarna Hernández, the pink party's local candidate
      in Molina de Segura, and the bearer of the ceremonial rose: \"we're going to
      be saved in the villages where people know us. It's very sad to lose it all
      after four years of hard work\".\r\n\r\nBoth she and the party's regional candidate
      for First Minister, César Nebot, insisted voting UPyD was not a waste of a vote
      because, he said: \"it defends citizens […] resigning yourself to the same old
      parties is\".\r\n\r\n\"Gangnam Style was a fashion and now no one dances it,
      right? So I wouldn't leave healthcare policy or education in the hands of the
      guy who invented Gangnam Style.\"\r\n\r\nRosa Díez, after receiving her pink
      rose, insisted, annoyed, during the questions at the press conference that she
      was not contemplating any other result than victory this Sunday, and argued that
      the fault of the collapse of UPyD in the \"manipulated\" polls was a Ciudadanos
      \"directed from afar by the IBEX 35\" (Spain's biggest companies), the establishment
      and her party only having €100,000 for the campaign this year: \"thirteen times less
      than four years ago\".\r\n\r\n\"When they take you out of the polls they also
      take away your bank financing\", she said.\r\n\r\nUnited Left leader Cayo Lara
      was equally outraged about the great conspiracy against his party. \"Capitalism\" has
      been their biggest strategic failure faced with the rise of Podemos, he said:
      \"We have always had a lot of failures but come on […] I've had less time on
      TV in my whole life and political career than some have had in a month […] these
      things don't happen by chance\"-\r\n\r\n\"Everyone has his reasons\", said the
      Ciudadanos candidate, Miguel Sánchez López, who spent four years in UPyD in
      Caravaca (Murcia) before joining the 'little oranges' with 140 colleagues at
      the end of last year, motivated by a disagreement with the national leadership over
      electoral lists and the lack of agreement between the two parties: \"but it's
      normal, anyway […] the national brand is important\", he said, showing off a
      photo of himself hugging national leader Albert Rivera on his mobile phone.\r\n\r\nThe
      night before, he had cancelled an interview with Popular TV \"because it belongs
      to the UCAM\" (a local Catholic private university), after its president, a
      local <em>eminence grise</em> called José Luis Mendoza, criticised Ciudadanos
      on a radio programme: \"I don't even want to imagine the PP not winning […]
      If they do a three-way coalition with Podemos, Ciudadanos and the PSOE, I think
      it would be the end for Murcia, the absolute end of our region\".\r\n\r\n\"The
      person who wants to be First Minister, the Popular Party candidate\", he said
      referring to Pedro Antonio Sánchez: \"is a Catholic who is totally against abortion,
      with very strong moral and ethical principles\".\r\n\r\nIn the same interview,
      the man responsible for the education of 14,000 students ranted against abortion,
      prostitution, the legalisation of drugs, the threats against and persecution
      of Catholics by \"the whole left-wing sector\", the coming invasion of Europe
      \"by Islam\" and the \"cowardly behaviour\" of the Rajoy government in Madrid.\r\n\r\nWhen the
      Deputy Prime Minister, Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría, came to visit the region's
      most powerful businessmen in April, PP supporters noted the absence of the normal
      PP blue and the seagull logo, compared to previous years.\r\n<h3>From Rodrigo
      Rato To Bolivia And Popular Patriotism</h3>\r\nA few days earlier, there was
      a debate between the candidates—all men—of the six main parties, which was not
      organised by a local media outlet but by UCOMUR, a cooperative union that later
      published election advertorials in the most widely read regional newspaper,
      La Verdad de Murcia (<em>whose editor later phoned to disagree with 'advertorial',
      preferring \"sponsored section\" or \"sponsored content\"</em>).\r\n\r\nIt was
      the evening they arrested Rodrigo Rato in Madrid. When the news was announced,
      joy, shouting and applause filled the room, with the exception of the Popular
      Party candidate, Pedro Antonio Sánchez, who launched straight into the official
      argument that \"the rule of law is the same for everyone\" in Spain.\r\n\r\nPodemos
      held the most successful rally in the south-eastern region. Pablo Iglesias's
      visit on the evening of May 15 caused thousands of people—they claimed 3,500—to
      queue like a hot snake around the central Parque del Fofó to get in. Fans climbed
      onto low roofs and looked through gaps in the fence to see the purple leader's
      harangue. The more anti-system the discourse, at a rally that ended well after
      11 p.m., the louder the applause and shouts of support.\r\n\r\nIglesias said
      the PP was wheeling out the zombies again, in reference to José María Aznar,
      whom he compared with Darth Vader. \"One cannot govern for everyone […] and
      it turns out those of us at the bottom are the majority\", he said, adding that
      they hoped to be \"the people's postmen\" and not \"butlers to the rich\".\r\n\r\nTwo
      Bolivian journalists at the rally said the Podemos philosophy was exactly the
      same as that of Evo Morales in Bolivia, but a few days later the candidate for
      regional First Minister, Óscar Urralburu, said at the party's HQ that \"the
      reference is not Bolivia, our reference is Norway\".\r\n\r\n\"We don't talk
      about jungles, we don't talk about big rivers, we don't talk about South America,
      we talk about a productive model based on research, development, innovation
      and that sees to the needs of this region, linking production to the European
      market.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not, though, specify how many years Mr. Iglesias and
      Mr. Errejón had spent in Oslo or Stockholm, and admitted he had not read their
      doctoral theses. Asked about the concept Podemos has of 'patriotism', he gave
      the example of the €10 million profit of the municipal water company, but ended
      up admitting that instead of going to the company's shareholders, the money
      would have to go \"to public spending\".\r\n<h3>Electoral Rhetoric And Criminal
      Complaints</h3>\r\nPodemos has filed a criminal complaint against three judges
      at the regional high court for abuse of power in a case affecting the PP candidate,
      Pedro Antonio Sánchez, and an auditorium in the town of Lorca, where he was
      Mayor. Podemos alleges their honours sent the case back to an ordinary court
      to avoid the PP candidate—who enjoys special legal protection as a politician—from
      being indicted again in the middle of the campaign.\r\n\r\nBefore going in to
      Pablo Iglesias's rally, Mr. Urralburu brandished a photo of the auditorium,
      still unfinished, and that same photo was to be found in the regional HQ of
      the PSOE, where its secretary general, Rafael González Tovar, said he could
      smell change, thanks to the \"very generalised corruption in the Popular Party
      leadership\".\r\n\r\nMurcian socialists have spent \"20 years crossing the desert\",
      he said, and their greatest failings have been \"restructuring and reorganising
      the party internally\" and \"communicating with citizens\".\r\n\r\nComfortable
      with using criminal complaints as electoral weapons, and the rhetorical argument
      that \"they're all corrupt\", Mr. González Tovar said he did not know if there
      had been a generalised commission scam amongst regional politicians, and he
      rejected accusing the PP directly of stealing citizens' money: \"The Popular
      Party is a very honourable party. Their leadership has committed crimes and
      we have filed complaints. The Popular Party is full of good people who don't
      share criminal positions or corrupt positions\".\r\n\r\nHe explained that judges
      keep rejecting the criminal complaints \"either because the complaints cannot
      be substantiated or because bribery is difficult to explain\" but is confident
      because they \"are still alive\".\r\n<h3>PP Refuses Interviews, Organises Small
      Rallies</h3>\r\nThe rallies with Mariano Rajoy in Murcia during the campaign
      were closed events and the PP, despite repeated requests from the middle of
      April onwards, refused interviews with Pedro Antonio Sánchez, José Ballesta,
      Ramón Luis Valcárcel or Miguel Ángel Cámara.\r\n\r\nThe first rally the Prime
      Minister attended, in a small sports centre next to the park where thousands
      would later queue to see Pablo Iglesias, brought together around 500 party faithful.
      Mr. Rajoy did not name Rodrigo Rato and nor did he speak more generally about
      corruption. Regional party members had already swallowed the official line that
      \"the rule of law works for all\", despite saying they felt \"disgusted\" at
      what had happened with the former director of the IMF.\r\n\r\nMr. Ballesta,
      the PP candidate for Mayor of the city, congratulated himself, congratulated
      all of the First Ministers and the Prime Minister, and congratulated Murcians
      for being Murcians. Speaking before the 500, with cameras broadcasting his every
      word to the world, he did not skip praise for \"the greatness of humility\".
      Mr. Valcárcel, the previous First Minister: \"had left his soul for Murcia\",
      he said, adding that: \"soul is God\". Those present, including Mr. Mendoza,
      the president of the private Catholic university UCAM, understood his reference
      and applauded loudly.\r\n\r\nThe second rally, in one of the halls in a local
      auditorium, attracted some 300 people. No one talked of Rodrigo Rato and the
      oratory and audience fervour reached new levels, after a very long speech by
      Pedro Antonio Sánchez and with Mr. Rajoy again promising stability and experience
      faced with the experimental Podemos or the sudden rise of Ciudadanos.\r\n\r\nAt
      both events journalists were offered the standard plasma TV screen, which most
      accepted.\r\n<h3>Anti-PP Deals &amp; Inexperienced Parties</h3>\r\nPSOE, UPyD,
      Podemos and United Left signed a \"regeneration\" agreement that became national
      news. Ciudadanos and the Popular Party said it was an \"anti-PP\" deal, and
      Ciudadanos did not sign it. Miguel Sánchez López denied they had been offered
      anything by the PP in exchange for staying out of the opposition deal: \"absolutely
      not, Ciudadanos does not do deals for seats at the top table\".\r\n\r\nIf the
      polls were right, the role of Ciudadanos—which six months ago hardly had a regional
      presence in Murcia and which now claims 1,400 members in the region—would be
      key. If they abstained or reached a deal with the Popular Party, the PP could
      continue to govern; if they joined the agreement with the other parties in the
      end, Murcia could become ungovernable, without either a majority for the party
      with the most votes or a majority of opposition parties.\r\n\r\nTheir candidate
      admitted that just a few weeks ago \"I wasn't ready\" for the big six-way debate
      but that a month and a half later he feels confident he can play that fundamental
      role next week—in a region with 1.5 million inhabitants and a regional GDP of
      €27 billion—if voters give them the eleven seats forecast.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think
      it's the same to be governed by a person who began in the youth wing of the
      party aged 15 or 16\", he asks: \"putting up posters, going round with a loudspeaker,
      giving out leaflets; someone who began as a councillor in his village and then
      ended up being a director general, a regional minister and who might become
      First Minister of the region without ever having worked a day outside of politics;
      or a person who is a university lecturer, a person who is a great doctor, a
      person who is a great engineer, a great lawyer, or wonderful civil servants?\".\r\n\r\nMurcia
      will have its answer on Sunday evening.\r\n<div id=\"updateX\" class=\"storyupdate\"><strong><em><a
      href=\"#updateX\">(UPDATE 1, May 26, 1:57 pm)</a>:</em></strong>\r\nIn the end,
      the <a href=\"http://resultadoselecciones2015.carm.es/15AU/DAU15999CM_L1.htm\">results</a>
      in a 45-seat regional parliament, needing 23 for a majority, were\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>PP:
      22</li>\r\n\t<li>PSOE: 13</li>\r\n\t<li>Podemos: 6</li>\r\n\t<li>Ciudadanos:
      4</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis outcome means the Popular Party is one seat short of
      an overall majority. United Left lost its only regional MP and UPyD went from
      zero not to a quarter but to a third of zero: 29,000 to 10,000 votes.\r\n\r\nIn
      Molina de Segura, Encarna Hernández and UPyD <a href=\"http://resultadoslocales2015.interior.es/99MU/DMU1530902799_L1.htm?d=600\">lost</a>
      their two seats on the local council.\r\n\r\nCiudadanos could still be the key
      in allowing the PP to govern in the region, or they could do a three-way coalition
      with the PSOE and Podemos—which would total 23—and deny the PP regional government
      for the first time since 1995.\r\n\r\n</div>"

    - How Spain's Local & Regional Elections Work
    - If you're confused by what is going to happen in the Spanish local and regional
      elections on Sunday, this article will help clear up what is going on and what
      is at stake.
    - "<strong>So, where are we?</strong>\r\nIt's election time in Spain again.\r\n\r\n<strong>Again?</strong>\r\nYep.
      The first round was on March 22, in Andalusia (<a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/15284/spanish-socialist-workers-party-psoe-wins-2015-regional-election-in-andalusia-on-36-of-the-vote/\">story</a>
      + <a href=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/15301/psoe-wins-in-andalusia-will-podemos-win-spain/\">editorial</a>).\r\n\r\n<strong>The
      first round? How many are there?</strong>\r\nLikely five this year. The first
      round was regional elections in Andalusia. There will also likely be regional
      elections in Catalonia at the end of September. The general election will probably
      happen in November or December, although there are some rumours Rajoy might
      go early, also in September.\r\n\r\n<strong>An early general election?</strong>\r\nMaybe,
      it's just a political rumour for now. He has reportedly ordered his party—the
      PP—to bring forward certain bills in parliament just in case.\r\n\r\n<strong>So
      what is happening on Sunday?</strong>\r\nRounds two and three. Local elections
      across the country and regional elections in 15 out of 19 Spanish regions.\r\n\r\n<strong>19
      minus Andalusia, minus Catalonia…that's 17, not 15…where else is missing?</strong>\r\nGalicia,
      in the north-west, and the Basque Country. Two very important regions, but they're
      doing their own thing, and last held regional elections in 2012, not 2011, so
      it's unlikely they'll be holding elections this year, although the first ministers
      in each region could always decide to go early. But not likely.\r\n\r\n<strong>Right,
      then, so local and regional elections.</strong>\r\nExactly. There are also some
      provincial elections going on, and elections for each island government in the
      Canary Islands (as well as elections for the regional government of the whole
      group of islands).\r\n\r\n<strong>Sounds complicated.</strong>\r\nIt is. In
      the local elections, 34,985,499 Spaniards and foreign residents will elect 8,122
      mayors, 2,955 district/borough mayors and 67,640 councillors. In the 15 regional
      elections, 19,960,064 Spaniards will elect 856 regional MPs. Plus the 1,040
      provincial MPs and 155 members of the island councils in the Canary Islands.\r\n\r\n<strong>And
      the difference in voter numbers is because not all regions are voting for regional
      MPs?</strong>\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\n<strong>What about the logistics?</strong>\r\n209,000
      ballot boxes in 23,322 polling stations, administered by 173,217 people. 90,000
      policemen will be on duty.\r\n\r\n<strong>What's all this regional parliament
      business?</strong>\r\nEach Spanish region has its own, with regional MPs, a
      regional government and a regional first minister. Ranging from the 25 regional
      MPs in Ceuta and Melilla to the 135 regional MPs in Catalonia.\r\n\r\n<strong>And
      expensive.</strong>\r\nRegional governments spent €164 billion in 2014, according
      to Finance Ministry data.\r\n\r\n<strong>Who's going to win?</strong>\r\nThe
      million dollar question. Polls are split. Depending on which regional parliament
      or City Hall you look at, they look like rainbows at this point.\r\n\r\n<strong>What
      have been the results in other local elections?</strong>\r\nThis graph provided
      by the Home Office shows the evolution of the overall voting percentages for
      the main parties in the local elections since 1979. This will be the key reference
      on Sunday night for one of the parties to declare some kind of overall victory.\r\n\r\n<img

      alt=\"elections-overall-local-results\" width=\"809\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>What
      about participation rates?</strong>\r\nRemarkably stable in the local elections.
      Here's the Home Office graph:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16386\"
      src=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elections-participation.jpg\"
      alt=\"elections-participation\" width=\"821\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>How good are
      the polls?</strong>\r\nHistorically, not great, and it varies a lot across Spanish
      regions. Politikon has a great <a href=\"http://politikon.es/2015/05/23/acertaran-esta-vez-las-encuestas/\">infographic</a>
      up which shows the variations. Basically, the bigger the grey area, the bigger
      the polls miss. As you can see, it changes a lot from year to year and region
      to region.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://politikon.es/2015/05/23/acertaran-esta-vez-las-encuestas/\"><img
      class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16384\" src=\"https://www.thespainreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/elections-politikon-range.jpg\"
      alt=\"elections-politikon-range\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<strong>How are
      we doing this year?</strong>\r\nThe last CIS survey field work was done in the
      middle of April, before a month and a half of mud slinging began that started
      with the arrest of Rodrigo Rato. That shows the PP would lose its majority in
      all but one Spanish region (Castilla y León). Two Metroscopia polls last weekend
      for El País showed the Podemos-like option in each major city had drawn equal
      with or surpassed the incumbent (PP in Madrid, CiU in Barcelona).\r\n\r\n<strong>What's
      really at stake?</strong>\r\nIn political terms, the real effect of the newer
      parties (Ciudadanos and Podemos) or their substitutes in the local elections.
      The key sticking point, if we take the negotiations in Andalusia as a proxy,
      is corruption and integrity. If the newer parties get a big share of the vote,
      or a better result than either of the two big established parties (PP and PSOE),
      it will change the focus of the political debate in the run up to the general
      election later in the year.\r\n\r\n<strong>Anything else worth noting?</strong>\r\nYes,
      the results in small villages, which are hugely weighted towards a more conservative
      vote. Here's that graph, which shows the PP with up to an 18 point lead over
      the PSOE in villages with up to 250 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter

      alt=\"elections-small-villages\" width=\"814\" />\r\n\r\n<strong>What time are
      the results out?</strong>\r\nPolls close at 8 p.m., Spanish time. First official
      provisional results expected at 10:30 p.m. on Sunday night.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where
      can I find the results?</strong>\r\nThe official Home Office local elections
      results page is <a href=\"http://locales2015.mir.es/web/locales2015\">here</a>.
      Regional results are more complicated, the 15 regional governments are responsible
      for their own results and pages. The Spain Report will explain it all in English
      for you as soon as the results start coming in.\r\n\r\nFor more context, read

    - Shallow Response From Spain After Oleg Naydenov Sinks Off Canary Islands With
      1,400 Tonnes Of Oil
    - The captain, the ship's owner, experts in oceanography and maritime pollution,
      and environmental and wildlife groups say the Spanish government is reacting
      too slowly and providing too little information about the state of the oil spill
      and its plan to fix the disaster.
    - "The Russian trawler Oleg Naydenov, frequently denounced by Greenpeace for illegal
      fishing activities, caught fire while in port in Las Palmas in the Canary Islands
      on Saturday, April 11. The 72 crew were rescued and Spanish port authorities
      decided to tow the ship out to sea, first eastwards and then south-west, around
      the island of Gran Canaria, where it sank some 15 miles south of Maspalomas,
      the southernmost tip of the island, at a point known by mariners and oceanographers
      for its depth (2,400 metres) and north-easterly winds and currents that wash
      objects south-west, out into the Atlantic Ocean, \"the route Christopher Columbus
      followed\", said Dr. Alonso Hernández, the Director of the Oceanography & Global
      Change Institute at the University of Las Palmas Gran Canaria, and a Professor
      of Physical Oceanography.\r\n\r\nIn statements made to the Public Prosecutor
      in Las Palmas, reported in Spanish media, the captain of the Oleg Naydenov said
      the fire had started in the machine room, but that Spanish authorities had not
      attempted to extinguish the blaze. He called the decision to move the ship out
      to sea \"a grave mistake\" and said that he had received no further news of
      its whereabouts: \"I know it sank thanks to reports in the press\".\r\n\r\nThe
      ship's owner, who did not identify himself to Spanish media, also complained
      of a lack of news: \"We have been asking the port authority for information
      about the ship since Saturday but no one is giving us information about how
      it is. We don't have a single document about what has happened\".\r\n\r\nThe
      former Director General of the Spanish Merchant Navy, Pedro Anatael Meneses,
      told Cadena SER radio station that he did not understand why water had been
      used to attempt to extinguish the fire instead of high-density foam, or why
      the boat was towed out to sea and left to sink: \"the actions taken in regard
      to the Oleg Naydenov were not correct and there were serious breaches of national
      and international regulations\".\r\n\r\nThe trawler was carrying 1,400 tonnes
      of fuel oil, 30 tonnes of diesel and 60 tonnes of lubricant oil, unknown quantities
      of which have now spilled out into the ocean, with a visible slick continuing
      to lengthen and spread south-west five days after the ship sank. A NASA satellite
      image of the area taken on Thursday, April 16 showed an l-shaped slick ending
      in a zig-zag and measuring approximately 40km. \r\n\r\nGreenpeace Spain hired
      a light aircraft and took off from the El Berriel airstrip near Maspalomas to
      overfly most of the area on Saturday morning. \"It's more than 70km long today\",
      said Juan De Dios Fernández, the organisation's point man for the disaster:
      \"which is how far we could go before they ordered our little plane to turn
      around, just as we reached the air exclusion zone they've set up over what the
      government says is the worst point\". He said his pilot had received notice
      as soon as they landed that any further overflights of the whole area—not just
      of the previous exclusion zone—by civilian aircraft had now been banned.\r\n\r\nContaminants
      continue to leak out of the wreck but information on the composition of the
      spill, how much might have leaked deeper down and how much is still contained
      in the wreck is also unknown. The Spanish Coastguard, using data provided by
      its SASEMAR 101 reconnaissance aircraft, estimated on Thursday that there were
      between 348 and 1028 tonnes of fuel oil in the slick: \"the measurement system
      our aircraft uses doesn't allow for more precise data than that, it's a broad
      estimate\", said a spokeswoman.\r\n\r\n\"We have no data\", says Dr. Hernández:
      \"The authorities haven't asked scientists to go and collect the data, and we've
      been trained with public money to direct all of our knowledge towards just this
      type of problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could be out there on the edge of the slick taking
      physical, biological and chemical measurements of it. We are Spanish scientists,
      the people who know most about oceanography in the Canary Islands\".\r\n\r\nHis
      colleague Jesús Cisneros, an expert in maritime pollution, said that by the
      appearance of the slick in images: \"it is probably fuel oil, it doesn't look
      like it's the diesel or the lubricant oil\".\r\n\r\nSome samples have been collected
      by the Spanish Coastguard but the results of the analyses will not be known
      for days. After a week of imprecise statements, the Spanish government said
      on Saturday that a submersible robot vehicle was set to arrive on Tuesday to
      dive down and inspect the wreckage and the state of the underwater spill. A
      spokesman for Otech Marine Services confirmed on Saturday evening that the Norwegian
      company had been contracted by the Spanish government to provide a Remotely
      Operated Vehicle (ROV) but could not confirm when that vehicle would arrive
      in the area or where in the world it was currently located.\r\n\r\nThree Coastguard
      boats were on scene by Friday, with a fourth due to arrive on Saturday night,
      but 25 knot winds and 2 metre waves mean anti-slick barriers are useless, and
      authorities have decided dispersants will not be used. Asked what the purpose
      of sending out four boats was if they were not doing anything beyond observing
      the spill, the Spanish Coastguard said they were \"doing some mechanical dispersion\",
      which consists of boats sailing over small parts of the slick to encourage it
      to disperse. \"That's not the clean up plan, though\", said a spokeswoman: \"they
      might or might not continue with that mechanical dispersion\".\r\n\r\nWhilst
      the beaches of Gran Canaria and Tenerife are safe for now, as long as the winds
      and currents keep pushing the slick out into the Atlantic, the spot where the
      Oleg Naydenov sank and is spilling fuel oil is renowned for its marine wildlife.\r\n\r\n\"There
      is an incredibly rich marine ecosystem there\", said Dr. Hernández: \"built
      on cyclical and anti-cyclical eddies that produce an extraordinary biological
      wealth\". Beatriz Ayala, the World Wildlife Fund coordinator for the emergency,
      confirmed that the area was a \"priority conservation area\", full of marine
      turtles, birds, whales, dolphins and porpoises: \"just where the ship sank\".
      Julio Barea, a Greenpeace spokesman in Madrid, said: \"the whole area is full
      of whales, cetaceans, up to 30 species live or pass through that area regularly,
      it's a migration channel\".\r\n\r\nThe Spanish government has made a formal
      request to EMSA, the European Maritime Safety Agency, for satellite imagery
      of the area, which the agency has provided, but Spanish authorities had not
      provided a copy of those images to this newspaper at the time of publication.
      EMSA said the images \"belonged to member states, who decide if they want to
      make them public\".\r\n\r\nWeather conditions are set to worsen overt the next
      few days, further hampering any attempt to begin to clean up the spill. The
      risk is that the winds might change direction and begin blowing north, pushing
      the slick back towards the beaches.\r\n\r\n\"They say they're dealing with it\",
      said Mr. Fernández: \"but we suspect they're too late again, they should have
      begun the rescue plan, now it's late. They should have given the orders already.
      The Ministry said their intention was to extract the fuel from the ship but
      for now they haven't done anything\".\r\n\r\nSpain's Public Works Ministry declared
      a level one maritime emergency on Thursday but has not published any details
      so far of a specific plan to extract any remaining fuel oil from the sunken
      trawler, or to clean up the slick.\r\n\r\n\"There was no proper contingency
      plan for the Canary Islands\", said Mr. Cisneros, the expert in marine pollution
      at the University of Las Palmas Gran Canaria: \"They're just making it up as
      they go along, with whoever's in charge\". He said he did not know if extracting
      any remaining fuel oil, diesel and lubricant oil was the best plan: \"it's 2,400
      metres deep, if you're going to spend all that money you have to look at what
      the result might be\", adding that: \"the [anti-slick] barriers are only useful
      in port or in a very calm sea. They're useless out there\"."

    - Not A Single High-Speed AVE Train Line In Spain Is Or Ever Will Be Profitable,
      Says A New FEDEA Study
    - All of Spain's high-speed rail corridors come up billions of euros short in
      50-year profitability studies; FEDEA's director tells The Spain Report the network
      was built for political reasons.
    - "Some of Spain's biggest businessmen sit on the <a href=\"http://www.fedea.net/organos-de-gobierno/\">board
      of trustees</a> of the Applied Economy Studies Foundation (FEDEA), including
      the chairmen of Bankia, Telefónica, Repsol, Iberdrola and La Caixa, and the
      Director General of Economics, Statistics and Research at the Bank of Spain.\r\n\r\nYesterday,
      the foundation published a <a href=\"http://www.fedea.net/docs/infraestructuras/presentaciones/GDR-2015-03.pdf\">damning
      new study</a> saying not a single one of the country's high-speed AVE rail lines
      is profitable, has been profitable or ever will be profitable, either in financial
      or broader \"social\" terms, if time-saving and reduced accident costs are accounted
      for.\r\n\r\n\"None of the lines should have been built\", says the report, although
      it allows for their continued operation: \"given that the lines already exist
      and most of them cover their variable costs\".\r\n\r\nÁngel De La Fuente, FEDEA's
      director, told The Spain Report by telephone that there were two possible explanations
      for the existence of Spain's high-speed network, given the total lack of profitability.\r\n\r\n\"Either
      the initial calculations were done badly or they weren't done at all\", he said:
      \"they didn't build them thinking about profitability but about the political
      benefits\".\r\n\r\n50-year studies of financial viability carried out by FEDEA
      show none of the major Spanish high-speed lines comes close to profitability.\r\n\r\nThe
      Madrid-Barcelona corridor comes up €4.08 billion short, the Madrid-Andalusia
      corridor €4.95 billion short, the Madrid-Levante corridor €5.32 billion short
      and the AVE lines north from Madrid do not even cover their operating costs.\r\n\r\nThe
      Madrid–Seville high-speed line is approximately the same length as the Tokyo–Osaka
      or Paris-Lyon lines, but carries only 3.8% of the passengers each year compared
      to the Japanese version, or 20% of the passengers compared to the French route.\r\n\r\n\"After
      they built the first line to Seville\", said Mr. De La Fuente: \"studies were
      done, but the politicians didn't pay any attention to them\".\r\n\r\nWhat's
      more, the data included in the study, when combined with an analysis of the
      way Spain's airport infrastructure mushroomed during the boom years, show that
      high-speed train use is largely replacing domestic air travel between Spanish
      airports.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 2014, the number of high-speed rail passengers
      on four key AVE lines between Madrid, Málaga, Barcelona, Valencia and Alicante
      had risen to just over 700,000 each month, the same level of passengers carried
      by domestic flights back in 2007.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, passenger numbers on internal
      flights in Spain fell to around the 300,000 per month mark, not many more than
      the 200,000–300,000 passengers the existing AVE lines carried in 2007.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding
      the economic implications, Mr. Rajoy's Popular Party government approved a new
      national infrastructure plan in 2013, called PITVI and set to run until 2024,
      in which 39% of the budget will be spent on further improvements to Spain's
      rail network.\r\n\r\nFEDEA's director agreed that: \"It's true that there are
      some lines that are nearly completed and it's worth finishing them, but there
      are new lines that are going to have a very low volume of passengers\".\r\n\r\nHis
      foundation's report concludes that Spain's high-speed rail network: \"does not
      resolve any large transport problem. It just substitutes for air travel in an
      inefficient way\", and adds that the new high-speed lines currently under construction:
      \"have even weaker demand than the previous ones. In the latest lines built,
      income does not cover variable costs\".\r\n\r\n\"The AVE is a wonderful train
      but it's very expensive\", said Mr. De La Fuente: \"and it's just before the
      elections again; they like opening new lines\".\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter

    - Investor Risk In Spain In 2015 All About Political Instability, Says Ureta,
      Chairman Of Renta 4
    - The chairman of Renta 4, which manages €14.4 billion in client assets, spoke
      to The Spain Report before a client presentation for small investors in the
      south-eastern city of Murcia.
    - "<strong>What is the global factor that is most affecting the economic situation
      right now?</strong>\r\n\r\nFrom a positive point of view, the two factors that
      are most affecting things are the whole process of digital society and tech
      revolution, and then emerging middle classes. Companies capable of taking those
      two processes are without doubt the ones we want to invest in, the winners.\r\n\r\nIn
      terms of instability, negative factors, without doubt the eurozone, and everything
      that surrounds it, the situation in Greece, there is an incorrect institutional
      design behind the euro, the situation in Ukraine is hiding much deeper problems,
      and all of the problems related to political situations in different eurozone
      countries, they are unsure because there are emerging parties, contrary to the
      system, in France Le Pen, in Spain Podemos, political situations that generate
      a certain sense of instability.\r\n\r\n<strong>If you had to choose between
      the situations in the Ukraine and Greece as a risk factor, which one would it
      be?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think in the medium term, Greece and Syriza, not because
      of Greece so much but because it highlights the bad design of the eurozone,
      there is no central authority, so if there's a government in any country that
      doesn't want to follow the rules, like Syriza, there's going to be a lot of
      instability.\r\n\r\n<strong>So you don't see the latest negotiations between
      Syriza, Varoufakis and Europe working well?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think they're
      doing the best negotiation they can, but in absolute terms I don't think it's
      good. They're trying to fix a problem that currently affects Greece but that
      in the future could affect other, more important, countries, but in the end
      there's a debt they want to mutualise, we have some tax policies and spending
      plans that are not managed centrally, so it's very difficult to mutualise the
      debt that comes from those policies.\r\n\r\nWhat we're seeing is that they're
      trying to solve the Greek problem, the central bank is helping a lot by injecting
      funds, but there are deeper problems that aren't being solved and they are problems
      with institutional structures in the eurozone.\r\n\r\n<strong>Which wouldn't
      be solved only by fixing Greece?</strong>\r\n\r\nNo, not with monetary solutions
      and not with fixing the specific problem of Greece. We'd meed a political management
      system for the eurozone, a governance model that is much more centralised. Or
      let each country default if they have to default. But trying to pay everyone's
      debt without being able to control spending is very complicated.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is
      there a default risk in Greece?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Greek debt will take some
      time to pay off. I don't know if that is default or not but you must think that
      Greece is currently paying it's debt off over the next 30 years, today, and
      it appears they want to extend it even further.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the Troika
      going to do a new deal?</strong>\r\n\r\nThey have to. European institutions
      are obliged to reach an agreement. The problem is that agreement will be for
      Greece but that the model of mutualising debt without common policies is very
      complicated.\r\n\r\n<strong>And is the Greek risk political risk?</strong>\r\n\r\nI
      think in Europe today there are more political risks than economic ones. With
      a cheap euro, very low interest rates, and abundant cheap money, low oil prices,
      Europe in theory has all the economic conditions in its favour. It has a political
      and institutional problem that is causing instability.\r\n\r\n<strong>Just Greece
      or are we also talking about Spain?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt's a European problem
      that is today manifesting in Greece. It's a eurozone problem that is today being
      expressed in Greece. Tomorrow it might be another country, France, Italy, Spain.\r\n\r\n<strong>How
      would you describe what's missing?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt's a lack of institutions
      that really guarantee the single currency. If you have a single currency, you
      have to have political institutions that bring that area together politically
      and economically, and they don't exist.\r\n\r\n<strong>And they're not going
      to build them?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem so for now.\r\n\r\n<strong>So
      how does that affect investors?</strong>\r\n\r\nInvestors should concentrate
      on specific assets, and there are very good companies in Germany, in Spain,
      in Greece, in Italy and investors don't talk about macro-economic factors or
      politics. We talk about very specific financial assets. So I think an investor
      has to look at macro and politics but above all at what he's investing in. There
      are companies in Greece worth investing in.\r\n\r\n<strong>How has the risk
      or threat of a Podemos government has increased since last May?</strong>\r\n\r\nI
      think there's a lot of hype around the idea of a Podemos government. I think
      what is real is that we're going to move from a bipartisan model with two main
      parties, one on the left, PSOE, and one on the right, PP, [a] bipartisan model
      that has worked well, basically well, over the last 30 years, it is a model
      that is going to move towards a four-party model, and one of them will be Podemos,
      and they will basically have the same level of electoral support. If that were
      true, we'd have a multi-party model that in Spain hasn't worked well at local
      level, or regional level. Look at the Catalan three-way deal, or the five-way
      split in the Balearic Islands.\r\n\r\n<strong>Political instability hasn't worked
      well historically in Spain either.</strong>\r\n\r\nDuring the democratic period,
      we haven't had experience of political instability, because there have been
      two parties exchanging power. If we get instability, it will be a new phenomenon,
      but in the democratic period we haven't had that experience.\r\n\r\n<strong>How
      could that period of political instability in Spain affect investments here?</strong>\r\n\r\nToday
      there is a lot of foreign investor confidence in Spain and they are not currently
      worried about the possibility of a lot of political instability. It seems they
      don't think it's a risk.\r\n\r\n<strong>Should they worry about it a bit more
      at this point?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think they know what they're doing. I think
      it's a risk that's out there, but when the markets aren't seeing it, there must
      be a reason. I'm surprised by how low peripheral European bonds are, Spain,
      Portugal, Italy, Greece and investors are being very complacent with those risks.
      I think people are being too complacent with European periphery risk and the
      eurozone.\r\n\r\n<strong>Why are bonds so low?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think part
      of it, the most important part, is the ECB's intervention, and then there's
      the other part which is economic stagnation and deflation.\r\n\r\n<strong>If
      we end up with both Syriza in Greece and either Podemos or an unstable coalition
      here, how does that affect things systemically?</strong>\r\n\r\nSpain is more
      important than Greece, it would affect things more. If there were a situation
      where it was impossible to govern, without a strong government, [it would affect
      things] for sure.\r\n\r\n<strong>So Pablo Iglesias is right about that: Spain
      is too big for them to do with Spain what they're doing with Greece?</strong>\r\n\r\nI
      don't think so, I don't know that opinion. In mine, Europe has rules and the
      rules must be followed in Greece or in Spain. It's true that Spain is very big
      so they couldn't reach the point of not following the rules they've reached
      in Greece. Greece is small.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do you agree with the Spanish government's
      forecast for growth this year, of 2-3%?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Spanish economy
      starts with cheap oil, cheap money and a cheap euro, so in theory things should
      go well for it. The risks are again political stability, but there aren't any
      others."

    - Gibraltar Chief Minister Blames Ageing PP Leaders For Lack Of Progress In Restoring
      Dialogue
    - Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo spoke to The Spain Report about the
      current Gibraltar–Spain impasse after giving his speech at the Palace Hotel
      in Madrid.
    - "<strong>What happened with the breakfast at the Ritz?</strong>\r\n\r\nFor me,
      the fact that my invitation had been circulated to everybody who was asked to
      attend had been advertised demonstrates that there were no issues of timetable
      or anything which affected that invitation and the statements from the organiser
      that he had been contacted by the Foreign Minister himself.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign
      Minister himself had alleged that for \"reasons of state\" suggested I not be
      invited to speak, I think sets up clearly what it is that happened and why it
      is that I was not able to deliver the speech at nine o'clock this morning at
      the Ritz, but I was very keen, once I'd been invited, to see through the presentation
      of the views of the people of Gibraltar in Madrid in a way that might help people
      to understand why we take certain positions and why we don't accept certain
      things.\r\n\r\nI think that's reasonable. I think there's absolutely nothing
      wrong with that. I didn't come in a way that was designed to be disrespectful
      to the government or the people of Spain and I think I've demonstrated that
      with what I've said this morning. It's a different point of view to that which
      is accepted in Madrid as the dogma.\r\n\r\nI think it's important, in the process
      of trying to move towards dialogue and to resolve this intractable historic
      problem that we demonstrate that we are ready to come and make the argument
      and not simply run away.\r\n\r\n<strong>Even closer to the Spanish Congress
      than the breakfast at the Ritz…</strong>\r\n\r\nI think this brings us closer
      to the Spanish Congress, but I was here last year staying at the same place,
      meeting representatives of all the political parties who have representation
      in the Spanish parliament, except the Partido Popular who didn't want at that
      stage to sit round a table and talk to us.\r\n\r\nFrom my own domestic politics,
      I'm hearing that sometimes political parties when they're in government take
      positions that they don't necessarily take when they're in opposition and they've
      got more time on their hands.\r\n\r\nI just hope that in the future, it will
      be possible for us to have interlocution with all of the political parties that
      have representation in the parliaments throughout Spain.\r\n\r\n<strong>You
      mentioned this period of differing narratives on Gibraltar in Spain and the
      UK is perhaps because of the Popular Party, similar to when José María Aznar
      was in power 15 years ago…</strong>\r\n\r\nI don't think I said that but the
      dates I gave said that… [chuckles]\r\n\r\n<strong>So this is a Popular Party
      attitude more than a Socialist Party problem? The trilateral talks were with
      the socialist government.</strong>\r\n\r\nYes, and I think it's also a generational
      issue. If you look at the generation of the people we were dealing with in the
      Socialist Party and the generation of the people I'm dealing with now under
      the Partido Popular, Gibraltar has been a dogma, it has been nailed into people's
      heads in Spain in the forties and fifties and for someone who was born then,
      who was in school then, and was brought up through that system, then obviously
      their views are going to be different to somebody who was brought up in the
      seventies and with democracy.\r\n\r\nSpain had wider issues to deal with that
      all communities and all countries have to deal with, rather than just having
      a foreign policy that was based on \"Gibraltar español!\", which were some of
      Margallo's first words when he became Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\n<strong>So not
      perhaps with a new generation of political leaders in Spain?</strong>\r\n\r\nWell
      that's my hope. Of course the Partido Popular represents people of a younger
      generation who may have a particular view.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that somebody
      under the age of forty doesn't think that Gibraltar should be Spanish, but I
      certainly think that people under the age of forty are more open to listening
      to others' points of views and trying to find ways to cooperate despite fundamental
      differences.\r\n\r\n<strong>Did the government of Gibraltar receive resistance
      from the Foreign Ministry about this breakfast?</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages,
      I suppose, of not having any interlocution, is that in the same way it creates
      a huge amount of disadvantages that we want to cure, when you want to organise
      an event like this, they haven' got an avenue by which to put pressure on you
      not to do it.\r\n\r\n<strong>From Fabian Picardo's point of view in Gibraltar,
      how does this response to the rejection of the Ritz Hotel help Fabian Picardo
      within his own political environment?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt's not about Fabian
      Picardo. I hope what it does is help Gibraltar get the message across to the
      widest possible group of opinion formers in Madrid about what the realities
      of Gibraltar and what the opportunities that Gibraltar presents are, in a way
      that would not have got across if we had not been able to organise this event,
      so this is about flagging up issues that people may not be conscious of because
      of the way Gibraltar is usually dealt with in the Spanish press, and the ability
      of the Spanish government, of course, to amplify its own view through the Spanish
      media, which we don't have. So I hope today goes a little bit of the way towards
      spreading our message.\r\n\r\n<strong>How did we get to this situation where
      in the Spanish press there is such a different narrative than the one we might
      see in the Gibraltar press or the UK?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt may be that we can't
      actually characterise the Spanish press as one, and that we have to look more
      closely to which parts of the Spanish press are making certain propositions,
      and which others are presenting a different view.\r\n\r\nThere are some parts
      of the Spanish press I have a lot of respect for, which play things straight
      and report what each side says. El País, for example, is a very clear example
      of a newspaper that will usually represent the reality that the government of
      Gibraltar puts to any of its journalists in a way that is accurate, fair and
      balanced.\r\n\r\nEl Mundo might also do that, but there are other sectors of
      the Spanish press which are very dogmatic and ideological in their approach
      to the Gibraltar and might be less open to representing to their readers an
      alternative point of view.\r\n\r\n<strong>There is much talk at the moment of deeper
      constitutional reform in Spain, to the level of asking what might be done with
      the autonomous communities [Spanish regions]: do you envision any kind of future
      scenario in which Gibraltar might become some part of some kind of future Spain?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
      answer is I don't, and I don't think there is any meaningful number of Gibraltarians
      who do. There might be some Gibraltarians who do. They are counted in the small
      percentage numbers you've seen in our previous referendum, nought point something
      might have voted to have joint sovereignty with Spain under the last referendum,
      for example.\r\n\r\nWhile I respect the right of people to believe what they
      want to believe, I will never represent a point of view that might include Gibraltar
      under the Spanish Crown, or Spanish sovereignty or the Spanish Constitution.\r\n\r\nEven
      if a majority of Gibraltarians were to take the view that that was the right
      way forward, I would then be in a minority party arguing that they would be
      making a mistake and that they should not do so. But that's what I believe,
      and I don't think I'll ever be in a minority in that respect in Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n<strong>You've
      been asked today about Podemos, contact with Podemos and what you think of a
      future Podemos government. Your remarks about the Gibraltar economy, however,
      were more British, perhaps, than Spanish in a certain sense. Looking deeper
      into the Podemos programme, and who has commented on it, they don't have that
      capitalist, pro-business agenda. The Venezuelan government has said that they
      would see a Podemos government as a favourable ally to Venezuela, even to weaken
      NATO and the EU. If there really were a Podemos government in Spain, with that
      kind of attitude, how would you see Gibraltar working with Spain then?</strong>\r\n\r\nI
      would wait until there was a Podemos government in Spain, and see what their
      policy on Gibraltar was, before sticking my colours the mast in any way.\r\n\r\nYou'll
      have to respect the fact that I want to scrupulously avoid making any comment
      on internal Spanish politics, because I think that would be provocative, and
      that's not what I'm here to do. I'm not here to try and involve myself and declare
      myself in favour or less favourable to any particular internal Spanish option.\r\n\r\nI
      respect the Spanish people's right to choose who their government should be
      and it's my obligation to then deal with that government if the people of Gibraltar
      return me as their Chief Minister after the next election.\r\n\r\n<strong>Which
      is in 2015?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe four years will be up on December 9, 2015. We
      don't have a fixed parliament, so we are in the position of the United Kingdom
      was before the Fixed Parliament Act, namely the Prime Minister calls an election
      when his wife or husband tells him to.\r\n\r\n<strong>The British Ambassador
      was explaining the intricacies of the quadrilateral, trilateral, bilateral and
      ad-hoc options for talks. At the minute, none of them are officially working,
      even the ad-hoc, more open, more informal option. What's stopping that?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt
      has been difficult to agree on the parameters of what the issues to deal with
      are, where we're going to deal with those issues, who the parties are going
      to be present will be.\r\n\r\nWe're saying that parties with constitutional
      competence should be the ones present, so agreeing those issues are the issues
      that have been perennial in ensuring we haven't been able to sit down.\r\n\r\nWhat
      I'm saying today is we have the will to go that extra mile in looking for agreement
      to make the ad-hoc talks a reality as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<strong>What
      kind of response would you expect from the Spanish government after your speech
      today?</strong>\r\n\r\nI would have hoped that they would see my posture was
      entirely conciliatory and positive and designed to try and ensure dialogue becomes
      a reality rather than just something we talk about.\r\n\r\n<strong>Would you
      invite Mr. Rajoy to give a similar speech in Gibraltar?</strong>\r\n\r\nI would
      be delighted if Mr. Rajoy, Mr. Margallo or any individual who is a politician
      in Spain were to come to Gibraltar and give such a presentation. Many have in
      the past, and there has been absolutely no difficulty in securing a venue to
      do so.\r\n\r\nThey would find that there would be huge respect for their right
      to make a presentation, although people would put the contrary argument to them
      as they are entitled to, as I think the people outside protesting are entitled
      to do with me. They have their freedom of expression too."

    - No Dialogue With Spain Over Gibraltar, UK Won't Discuss Sovereignty, Says British
      Ambassador
    - The British Ambassador to Spain, Simon Manley, spoke to The Spain Report about
      the situation in Gibraltar after introducing Chief Minister Fabian Picardo at
      a breakfast meeting in Madrid.
    - "<strong>What is the British government's broad position on Gibraltar at the
      moment?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think we've made our position very clear. In parliament
      there has been a quite recent debate on the back of a report that the Foreign
      Affairs Committee did last year.\r\n\r\nWe've been worried by some of the problems
      that we've had with the controls at the border and the rest. The key thing for
      us now, as the Chief Minister said, is that we want to move ahead to a process
      of ad hoc talks.\r\n\r\nOf course we would prefer to return to the trialteral
      format we enjoyed before, the UK, Spain and Gibraltar sitting at the same table,
      and one day we hope we'll be able to return to it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Not the quadrilateral
      format that the Spanish government is talking about?</strong>\r\n\r\nBoth we
      and the Spanish government, to be fair, are trying to find a way in which we
      can have a genuinely ad-hoc format, it's quite tricky.\r\n\r\n<strong>How would
      the ad-hoc format work exactly?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have the formalism
      of the old trilateral format, and we hope that the whole variety of interested
      parties could be part of it, and it wouldn't be a substitute for the trilateral
      talks to which we'd like to return.\r\n\r\nThe key thing is that you can sit
      down without a great deal of formalism and flags and the rest of it to look
      at the issues where we think we could work better together.\r\n\r\n<strong>So
      by ad-hoc we are to understand three-party informal talks or four-party informal
      talks?</strong>\r\n\r\nA series of parties. We're open to participation by the
      Andalusian regional government and local authorities in La Linea.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is
      the increased belligerence in the Spanish media of late because of the Popular
      Party government?</strong>\r\n\r\nI don't think I'll get into the business of
      characterising the views of one party or one government. We have a free press
      in the UK and in Gibraltar and in Spain and it keeps everything quite…lively.
      That's part of living in a democracy.\r\n\r\nAs I said in my opening comments,
      what struck me on visiting Gibraltar was the extraordinary economic potential
      that lies there, the dynamism, the creativity, the entrepreneurialism of the
      Gibraltarian economy, to create a wider zone of prosperity there beyond the
      borders into La Linea and beyond.\r\n\r\n<strong>Do non-official, informal contacts
      exist between the three governments on a more-or-less day-to-day basis anyway?</strong>\r\n\r\nNot
      really. There isn't a kind of hidden format there, no hidden talks.\r\n\r\nWe
      obviously talk all the time to the Chief Minister and his colleagues, we talk
      to the Spanish government, but there isn't currently a format, a forum in which
      we can all sit together and discuss these issues, which is why we're trying
      to create this ad-hoc formula which will enable us to discuss some of these
      issues which we think are of mutual interest.\r\n\r\n<strong>So there's no dialogue
      at the moment between the three parties?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe're not all sitting
      down together, no. We're all speaking to each other, but there isn't an existing
      format.\r\n\r\n<strong>Has there been a more confrontational attitude from parliament
      in the UK over the past couple of years?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think the people
      and the parliamentarians of the United Kingdom have a very strong emotional
      attachment to the people of Gibraltar who, after all, have voted in favour or
      remaining part of the UK, and you see that in the views and opinions of British
      MPs, members of the House of Lords, the government and the British press.\r\n\r\nWe
      take very seriously the situation in Gibraltar and as British Ambassador here,
      it's part of my job to do what I can to explain those views and to do what I
      can, working with my colleagues back in London, and the Chief Minister and the
      Governor of Gibraltar to ensure that we promote the interests, prosperity and
      security of the people of Gibraltar, and work towards that arc of prosperity.\r\n\r\n<strong>What
      more could the British government and the British Embassy be doing towards that
      end?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think doing what we've tried to do today, and what we
      do day in, day out, which is to enable dialogue, to explain the reality of Gibraltar.
      The popular view of Gibraltar here [in Spain] has remarkably little to do with
      the actual reality of life in Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n<strong>Why is there such a
      difference in the narrative between the two places?</strong>\r\n\r\nI think
      relatively few people have been to Gibraltar. I think if you go and visit you
      find a territory which has this extraordinary melting pot of Mediterranean cultures,
      of Jews, Muslims and Christians living together, of a fabulous mosque that sits
      besides a monument to General Sikorsky, the leader of the Polish resistance.
      It's a territory of extraordinary contrasts and vitality, cultural vitality
      and social interaction.\r\n\r\n<strong>But why this continuing difference in
      the narratives and the way the same story and facts are portrayed in two different
      ways on the two sides?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt happens in lots of different situations,
      I don't think this is the only one. I think it's part of my job here to try
      and explain the reality as I see it. Other people have their different views
      of it. That's the healthy diversity of a flourishing democracy.\r\n\r\n<strong>As
      a diplomat, how do you interpret the cancellation of Mr. Picardo's breakfast
      at the Ritz?</strong>\r\n\r\nWe regretted it. The important thing is that he's
      here today speaking to this audience of politicians, businessmen, diplomats,
      journalists and is able to explain his vision for Gibraltar and the economic
      development that could take place given that extraordinary potential, that arc
      of prosperity.\r\n\r\n<strong>Was the breakfast cancelled at the behest of the
      Spanish Foreign Ministry?</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm not going to get into that. The
      important thing is we're here today and we spoke very well of the challenges
      and opportunities. That's the important thing.\r\n\r\n<strong>With all the talk
      of deep constitutional reform in Spain at the moment, does the British government
      envision any future scenario in which Gibraltar might become a part of Spain?</strong>\r\n\r\nNo.
      We've been very clear that we're not going to enter into a discussion of sovereignty
      over the heads of the people of Gibraltar. You heard the Chief Minister's words,
      and he speaks as the representative of the people of Gibraltar. He can speak
      for them rather better than me."

    - '"Gibraltar is absolutely not an obscure tax haven", Says Gibraltar First Minister
      In Madrid Speech'
    - 'Spain''s Foreign Minister said "it was fine" for Fabian Picardo to speak in
      Madrid: "as long as no one forces me to listen". The Chief Minister was introduced
      by the British Ambassador.'
    - "In a breakfast speech in central Madrid to a room filled with some 250 politicians,
      businessmen, diplomats and journalists at the Palace Hotel—directly opposite
      the Spanish Congress building on the Carrera de San Jerónimo—Mr. Picardo left
      the ball firmly in Madrid's court after the Spanish Foreign Ministry intervened
      two weeks ago to prevent him speaking at a similar event at the nearby Ritz
      Hotel.\r\n\r\nA small group of Spanish nationalists waving Spanish flags welcomed
      the Chief Minister outside, in protest at his visit.\r\n\r\n\"What does Spain
      win by closing all relations with a small territory like Gibraltar which is
      on its border?\", he wondered: \"We do not wish to become the corner stone of
      Spanish foreign policy. It is incredible that two territories that border each
      other do not cooperate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dialogue is a political instrument, not an
      end in itself\".\r\n\r\nThe British Ambassador, Simon Manley, did, in the end,
      attend the event and introduced Mr. Picardo, saying the breakfast meeting \"should
      facilitate cooperation\" between the UK, Spain and Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish
      Foreign Minister, José Manuel García Margallo told journalists at a trade conference
      in Murcia that \"it was fine\" for Mr. Picardo to speak in Madrid: \"as long
      as no one forces me to listen\".\r\n\r\nReferring to President Obama's recent
      change in attitude towards Cuba and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's own
      new agreement with Andorra, the Chief Minister said he hoped a new deal could
      now also be reached on Gibraltar: \"Times have changed and are still changing.
      I hope the same openness can now be applied to Gibraltar, beyond the already
      existing agreements\".\r\n\r\nGiven the non-existence of official bilateral,
      trilateral or quadrilateral dialogue at the moment, both Mr. Manley and Mr.
      Picardo expressed hope that a move could be made towards the establishment of
      more open, informal, \"ad-hoc\" talks between the parties.\r\n\r\n\"The absence
      of dialogue in the trilateral forum is not going to help create a return to
      bilateral dialogue\", he said, adding that: \"With our backs turned to each
      other, no one is going to achieve anything\".\r\n\r\nThe previous tripartite
      agreement had been the format that had worked best \"to great mutual benefit\",
      said the Chief Minister, suggesting Spain's Popular Party government was equally
      if not more responsible for the conflictive rhetoric surrounding Gibraltar over
      the past few years: \"The media environment now is very similar to the period
      between 1997 and 2003\", he said, in reference to the period in which former
      Popular Party Prime Minister José María Aznar was in the Moncloa.\r\n\r\nMr.
      Picardo said the four-party format the Spanish government has suggested—with
      the inclusion of the Andalusian regional government in negotiations—is \"not
      right. The Gibraltar government is not a regional administration\". \r\n\r\nAsked
      why Spanish, British and Gibraltar governments were not able to advance towards
      even the informal \"ad hoc\" talks, he replied that the governments were \"still
      trying to schedule dates\".\r\n\r\nOn the most notorious issue currently defining
      Spanish-Gibraltar relations, Mr. Picardo firmly rejected repeated suggestions
      by Spanish government officials that Gibraltar was a tax haven or a smuggling
      den, or that somehow European Union legislation was not \"fully\" applied in
      the territory.\r\n\r\n\"Gibraltar is absolutely not an obscure tax haven. It
      complies rigorously with European agreements. There are no reasons for our tax
      authorities not to provide fiscal data to the Spanish tax authorities.\"\r\n\r\nHe
      said Gibraltar tax authorities had now processed \"dozens\" of information request
      from their Spanish counterparts, and that the long queues Gibraltar residents
      and Spanish workers have to put up with to cross the border \"are politically
      motivated\".\r\n\r\n\"They are not tax or customs related and they affect everyone
      in the same way\".\r\n\r\n\"In Gibraltar, we have managed to bring the issue
      of tobacco smuggling under control on our side without the need for long queues.\"\r\n\r\nIn
      response to repeated questions about his government's contacts with Podemos,
      the Chief Minister said he was not appropriate for him to comment, but that
      informal contacts are maintained with all Spanish political parties: \"One day,
      perhaps a Spanish politician is going to wake up and ask what on earth they
      have been doing with Gibraltar. I don't know if that politician will be from
      t\r\n\r\nHe said that the idea of Gibraltar one day becoming a Spanish region:
      \"was about as bad as the idea of Ceuta and Melilla being handed over to Morocco.
      It wouldn't be a bad thing if that's what the people of Gibraltar decided they
      wanted\"."

    - What's Sacred In Spain? Satire, Journalism & Freedom Of Speech After The Charlie
      Hebdo Attack
    - The Spain Report spoke to a veteran Spanish cartoonist, a publisher of satire
      who spent 8 years in prison for terror crimes and a conservative columnist and
      talk show host about Charlie Hebdo, freedom of the press and the most provocative
      satire south of the Pyrenees.
    - "Guillermo is a cartoonist who has drawn for many years in Spanish daily El
      Mundo. He is also one of the founding partners of <a href=\"http://www.orgulloysatisfaccion.com/\">Orgullo
      y Satisfacción</a>, the new online offshoot of the well-known satirical magazine
      El Jueves. 14 cartoonists walked out in June 2014 after publisher RBA withdrew
      60,000 copies of a controversial \"Crown of Steaming Shit\" front page cartoon
      mocking the abdication of Juan Carlos I and the proclamation of Felipe VI.\r\n\r\nLuis
      del Pino is the editor of an <a href=\"http://esradio.libertaddigital.com/\">online
      radio show</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.libertaddigital.com/enigmas-del-11-m/\">blogger</a>
      on the conservative news site Libertad Digital, and has authored books on the
      11-M train bombings that took place in Madrid in 2004.\r\n\r\nGonzalo Boye,
      who holds both Chilean and German nationality, is a controversial media figure
      in Spain, having been convicted of a terror offence—the 1988 ETA kidnapping
      of Basque businessman Emiliano Revilla—in 1996. Mr. Revilla was held hostage
      for 249 days and Mr. Boye sentenced to 14 years and 6 months in prison. He maintains
      his innocence but served 8 years and, having studied law whilst locked up—\"to
      defend others as I would have like to have been defended\"—became a human rights
      lawyer before going on to publish the satirical magazine <a href=\"http://www.revistamongolia.com/\">Revista
      Mongolia</a>.\r\n\r\nThey were all affected by what happened at Charlie Hebdo
      in Paris last week. Mr. Boye rushed to secure the rights to the French cartoons
      to publish them online in solidarity. Among Spanish cartoonists, though, there
      was fear, says Guillermo: \"Real fear? For sure. I don't have the balls to draw
      Mohammed because I've got a family. I'm a coward\". He knew Wolinski, one of
      the murdered cartoonists in Paris.\r\n\r\n\"Wolinski was 80, I started learning
      about satire with him, with them, and French magazines more than anything else.
      They were at another level. We had just come out of the Franco era. Their irreverence,
      their troublemaking was enviable, first at Hara Kiri and then Charlie Hebdo.
      He encouraged me to keep going\".\r\n\r\nIs there a line, though, that should
      not be crossed, between irreverent, provocative trouble making and offence?
      Is there a point at which satire turns into offensive and potentially dangerous
      hate speech?\r\n\r\nMr. Del Pino believes there is, and that the last word should
      lie with a judge and the rule of law in the case of dispute, if a writer or
      artist does not accept his share of the responsibility that accompanies freedom
      of speech: \"In the civilised world, clearly everyone can publish what they
      want to, but there are laws. Slander exists, as do rules against offending religious
      sentiment\".\r\n\r\n\"La Razón struck the right balance with the Charlie Hebdo
      cartoon it chose for its front page homage the day after the attack. It was
      elegant, commenting on the contrast between Muslims, not going after all of
      them.\"\r\n\r\nThose laws should be especially sensitive with deeply held religious
      sentiment—that many hold dear as a fundamental part of their human identity—he
      adds: \"I don't identify with the Charlie Hebdo cartoons at all. I don't need
      to laugh at Muslims, Christians or Jews. Charlie Hebdo was making fun of the
      beliefs of millions of people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Boye disagrees: \"The jihadis who
      don't interpret the Koran properly are doing something absolutely abhorrent.
      Their right to religious freedom is not superior to our right to freedom\".
      \r\n\r\nHe believes current laws put Spanish satirists \"in a difficult legal
      position\" when it comes to drawing provocative commentary on the nation's events,
      and says things are about to get worse as the government changes existing laws—notably
      the \"Gag law\" that prohibits images being taken of police officers in public
      places, and an upcoming addition that will criminalise \"regularly reading\"
      of terrorist websites—to further restrict the ability of journalists: \"to report
      properly, never mind do satire\".\r\n\r\n\"Are they going to give journalists
      and researchers special passes?\"\r\n\r\nGuillermo agrees with aspects of both
      points of view, saying that while hate speech on Twitter in the wake of violent
      attacks is reprehensible: \"it's violence, instead of a machine gun you have
      a tweet\", many Spanish journalists \"haven't interiorised what freedom of speech
      really means: that you can say things that I don't like or that offend me\".\r\n\r\nFrance
      has a large, multi-generational Muslim population. In Spain, by contrast, and
      whilst the number of Muslim immigrants skyrocketed in line with the general
      immigrant population during the boom years, there have not so far been the clashes
      and tensions over beliefs and rights seen on the other side of the Pyrenees.
      Which topics are the most provocative in Spain, the ones satirists almost dare
      not touch?\r\n\r\n\"The 2004 train bombings\", says Mr. Del Pino: \"Very few
      care about the Civil War, there were people on both sides in lots of families.
      That was another Spain.\" Certain modern politicians, he explains—naming the
      leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias—are very well aware of the deeper identity
      problems affecting Spanish politics: \"In Podemos rallies, they've got rid of
      all of the republican flags the left always gets out, and have done the same
      in Catalonia\".\r\n\r\n\"The most untouchable topic in Spain is the Civil War\",
      says Guillermo: \"We're still at war, we have been since the 18th Century. Priests
      versus atheists, right against left. The monarchy is part of that, it belongs
      to the Franco side, the Church and the right. It's not above them, it is part
      of that side. All Spain's kings have been a disaster for the country, enemies
      of the people is an understatement\".\r\n\r\n\"The Church and the King\", says
      Mr. Boye: \"every time we criticise the Catholic Church we get threats and insults.
      It's all about the most backwards aspect of Spanish culture\", adding that:
      \"The civil war didn't just appear out of nowhere. It was the consequence of
      the clash between the Two Spains\".\r\n\r\nAll three seem to agree there is
      hypocrisy inherent in statements made in defence of freedom of expression and
      freedom of the press following a terror attack and then business as usual the
      day afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"Having a go at the Church is free, gratuitous\", says
      Mr. Del Pino: \"But why don't they do cartoons against Saudi Arabia, have a
      go at the oppressor. There is a huge contradiction. They shouldn't apply different
      rules\".\r\n\r\n\"The same politicians spout 'Je Suis Charlie', after passing
      the Gag Law\", says Mr. Boye: \"Why haven't they extradited Martin Villa or
      [former Justice Minister] Gallardón's father-in-law to stand trial in Argentina?\",
      referring to a recent request made by an Argentinian judge investigating Franco-era
      crimes.\r\n\r\n\"This government has obviously shown it wont' hesitate when
      it needs to go after media outlets that don't share its opinion\", says Guillermo:
      \"What has taken place at [state broadcaster] TVE is a scandal. And now we have
      a Prime Minister who hates the press, who doesn't read much, and the plasma
      screen business [at press conferences] is just contemptuous, he's laughing at
      citizens […] and then he pretends he's a democrat. It's all just a huge joke\".\r\n\r\nGuillermo
      also has harsh words for mainstream media outlets regarding their advertisers:
      \"Look at [Emllio] Botín, the master dead. Santander owns 90% of the Spanish
      press. What use is so much talk of France when you can't criticise the guy who
      buys the ad space in your newspaper? Come on. One thing is not to say anything
      but another is to suck up to them\".\r\n\r\n\"Something has changed, though,
      after Charlie Hebdo\", he adds: \"it will never be like it used to be, freedom
      of expression has been mortally wounded\".\r\n\r\n\"We need less talk about
      abstract concepts and more though about human beings\", says Mr. Del Pino: \"If
      we all did that, it would be marvellous\".\r\n\r\nAsked if he would dare to
      publish an irreverent cartoon of the Spanish King in a compromising sexual encounter
      with Mohammed, Mr. Boye recoils slightly: \"the only criteria we use is to not
      break the Criminal Code\", but adds in reference to his cartoonists that: \"the
      boys have been on fire lately, we might surprise you one day soon\"."

    - 'The Podemos Plan For Spain''s Towns & Cities: Debt Haircuts, Control, Transparency
      And Patriotism'
    - Toni Carrasco, Podemos's new secretary general in the south-eastern city of
      Murcia, spoke to The Spain Report about hope and outrage, grassroots infrastructure,
      more control over elected politicians, the re-municipalisation of public services
      and local debt haircuts.
    - "57-year-old Toni Carrasco has been a secondary school teacher for the past
      27 years and has been participating in left-wing politics in Murcia, Spain's
      seventh-largest city: \"for the last 30 years or so in different ways\". He
      spoke to The Spain Report on Friday evening in Itaca, a local bar near the city's
      bull ring, and said that while obviously the local examples in each town or
      city are different, his opinions and explanations were broadly representative
      of the ideas he has discussed with his Podemos colleagues in other towns in
      Spain.\r\n\r\nHis mission, he said, is not to run for mayor—there is still debate
      over a \"transversal\" electoral list with other left-wing organisations in
      time for May—but to build up the party's grassroots infrastructure in the regional
      capital and the surrounding villages.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE)
      was last in power in Murcia in 1995 and has proven incapable since of regaining
      power from the Popular Party, but: \"the fear of the <em>señorito</em> [the
      local power elite] and their capacity to repress\" is still there: \"You don't
      participate, you don't have an opinion, there has never been confidence in a
      rational, democratic reaction on the right. The system is slanted towards power,
      more than towards the right\".\r\n\r\nPodemos is changing that, he says, and,
      despite polling analysis showing a clear majority of the party's support is
      coming from the left—and further left than the Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE)—he
      insists, as do national party leaders, that Podemos is constructing a \"transversal\"
      political proposal that supporters will elect to wipe the political slate in
      Spain clean: \"what Pablo Iglesias, Iñigo Errejón and Carolina Bescansa have
      managed to do is communicate that it is possible to break that barrier, something
      the left was never able to do. We believe it's a new way of looking at politics,
      a tool for citizens faced with the almost absolute power of the 1%, who decide
      everything\".\r\n\r\nHe rejects the label of a new municipal Popular Front:
      \"because the label Popular Front has negative connotations that frighten people,
      and it doesn't really say very much, instead of encouraging participation it
      puts a brake on it\". He also rejected comparisons to Venezuela, Cuba or Marxism:
      \"I don't like labels, they don't explain anything, I prefer content\".\r\n\r\n\"There
      is a huge amount of work to be done in Podemos. We're building something that
      didn't exist a year ago. [The lack of infrastructure] is why we are not running
      in the local elections. We can't offer people guarantees of transparency yet.
      We want to build a long-term project\", although he later added that the strategy
      was related to control of municipal budgets: \"which are decided at the state
      level\".\r\n\r\nTo achieve its medium- to long-term goal, Podemos is weaving
      a complex interlinked network of local, regional and national territorial and
      issues-related circles, popular assemblies, citizens' councils and secretary
      generals. Mr. Carrasco says it is not about reinventing the wheel so much as
      giving voters more direct control of the electoral process, electoral programmes,
      candidates and their political leaders once the elections are over: \"We want
      more control over mayors. Democracy is not just voting every four years. We
      want to change the rules of the game, there are lots of democratic holes in
      the current system\".\r\n\r\n\"It would not be possible to explain the Podemos
      phenomenon without the economic crisis, the popular response, the marches, the
      cutbacks, the employment reform, cut backs on dependency allowances. That's
      the new situation, compared to before, that loss of rights\", he explained:
      \"The 15M movement has also been crucial, because it questioned the whole political
      model that caused the cuts. Without those two things, Podemos wouldn't have
      been born\".\r\n\r\nPodemos supporters, he says, are fed up, angry and outraged:
      \"people are desperately looking for a solution for their lives, and for the
      situation in general\".\r\n\r\n\"I haven't noticed a big sociological change
      in all these years, but the veil has fallen for lots of people at this point,
      having seen how politicians have behaved: before people didn't question them
      as much, but after all the cuts and corruption, they just see them as shameless
      and self-interested.\"\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge, he admits, is \"turning
      ideas into specific real policies\".\r\n\r\nMr. Carrasco said the controversial
      change to Article 135 of the Spanish Constitution was an outrage, adding that
      whilst balanced budgets are in theory a good idea: \"we're talking about lots
      of useless spending on massive ego projects. In Murcia there are three: the
      AVE high-speed train, the airport and the Cartagena-Vera [toll] motorway\",
      which one local think tank reported would take 675 years to become profitable.\r\n\r\nWhat
      about reality, though? Would an elected Podemos mayor be able to resist the
      cultural inertia of business as usual in southern Spain? What happens when the
      first CEO or chairman rings to congratulate the mayor and talk about promising
      new deals for the city? \"That is what wouldn't be acceptable, that first leg
      of ham, the first lunch invite, is what can't happen. If they need to talk to
      City Hall, they must use the proper public channels\".\r\n\r\nMr. Carrasco says
      the party fears it will find \"huge amounts\" of unpaid invoices in town halls,
      \"that could be used to pressure us\".\r\n\r\n\"The first thing we would do
      is audit the debt, and find out what has really been spent, and on what, and
      if it isn't legitimate, it is superfluous\", he explained, adding they would
      sit down with local contractors and suppliers to renegotiate service contracts,
      up to and including municipal debt haircuts: \"we would look at the refinancing
      options. We believe many services have been contracted at a more expensive rate
      than is necessary because they have been privatised. We would re-municipalise
      public services: water, rubbish collection, buses, etc.\".\r\n\r\nIn Murcia,
      one of the largest local projects in recent years has been the city's new tram
      service, which runs from the centre up to the university in one direction and
      up to two large new shopping centres—which have moved much of Murcia's commercial
      activity away from small shops and businesses—in the other. There is talk of
      extending the tram south across the river to connect with the train station,
      and possibly even the regional hospital, and proposals from architects appear
      regularly in the regional press, but Mr. Carrasco struggles to articulate how
      the dream of would be turned into an already-existent reality.\r\n\r\n\"The
      tram hasn't solved the transport problem, and has been a big source of municipal
      debt\", he said: \"but we're not going to stop using it, of course\".\r\n\r\nHow,
      then would a Podemos city hall convince big business to continue investing in
      the city's infrastructure if the plan was to enter tough new negotiations to
      demand debt haircuts, and with the not-very-veiled threat of the re-municipalisation
      of public services hanging in the air? Again, he admitted it would be difficult:
      \"Many of them are not even Spanish companies, they just look at bond profits,
      not if they're doing something good for citizens. What we would ask of them
      in one word is 'patriotism'\".\r\n\r\nIn the American sense of the word or the
      revolutionary Venezuelan sense? \"In the sense that patriotism is not current
      accounts, but the people who live here. More solidarity. They can't say they
      like Murcia or Spain and then take all the money to Switzerland or Andorra\".
      A revolutionary tax? \"No, we want to do what many other countries in Europe
      do, we're not talking about Venezuela or Cuba\".\r\n\r\nHe believes municipal
      contractors must accept tough new conditions as well as a debt haircut: \"If
      they want to do business with the city, they'll have to accept new conditions,
      the city is also a customer\", adding: \"we need more transparency, things could
      be done more economically. We would add service demands, renegotiate the debt,
      and add conditions, to re-municipalise the services\".\r\n\r\n\"Creditor companies
      will have to be understanding with towns and cities. If a company puts pressure
      on you, that pressure will have to be made public.\""

    - Home Secretary Fernández Díaz Says Meeting With Rato Was "In No Way Secret Or
      Clandestine"
    - El Mundo reported he had held a meeting with Rodrigo Rato on July 29 at the
      Home Office.
    - "Spanish Home Secretary Jorge Fernández Díaz appeared before a parliamentary
      commission on Friday morning to make statements on his July 29 meeting with
      the former head of the IMF, Spanish Economy Minister and Deputy Prime Minister
      Rodrigo Rato, who is being investigated for fraud and money laundering.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
      at a session of the Spanish Congress's Home Affairs Commission, where his statements
      were the only item on the order of the day in the middle of August, he said
      that he was \"very aware\" his meeting with Mr. Rato, which had lasted \"almost
      an hour\", had caused public criticism.\r\n\r\nHe repeated several times that
      the meeting had taken place in a \"transparent\" manner and that it had in no
      way been \"secret or clandestine\".\r\n\r\n\"I had no doubt the meeting had
      to take place and that it had to take place at the Home Office\"\r\n\r\nThe
      existence of the meeting was made public in a news report by Spanish daily El
      Mundo.\r\n\r\nMr Fernández Díaz said the meeting had taken place at the Home
      Office to \"ensure the personal security\" of Mr. Rato, who wanted to talk about
      an issue that the Home Secretary labelled \"well founded\", mentioning the existence
      of some 400 \"offensive tweets\" against the former Deputy Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\"I
      received Mr. Rato in my capacity as Home Secretar to talk exclusively about
      his personal security\", he said, explaining that he had decided to take \"personal
      responsibility\" for the matter given Mr. Rato was a former minister.\r\n\r\nHe
      denied he had interceded on Mr. Rato's behalf \"before any public administration\"
      regarding the investigation into the former director of the IMF for \"alleged\"
      fraud and money laundering.\r\n\r\nMr. Rato, explained the minister, had a personal
      protection service as a former Deputy Prime Minister and Mr. Rato was: \"concerned
      that it might be removed\".\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the Home Office issued a statement
      saying the Home Secretary's meeting with Mr. Rato had been at the request of
      the former head of the IMF to deal with \"exclusively personal\" matters and
      had had \"absolutely nothing to do\" with the investigation of Mr. Rato.\r\n\r\nThe
      Spanish Socialist Party (PSOE) announced on Thursday that it had made a formal
      petition to the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the Home Secretary
      on charges of abuse of authority."

      there is something about Las Meninas that ultimately persuades the viewer that
      there is much more to it than what immediately meets the eye. The way in which
      all of the figures appear isolated in their own worlds. The almost supernatural
      brilliance of a technique whereby, in the words of Palomino, brushstrokes that
      from close up are barely intelligible should appear miraculous from a distance.</blockquote>"

    - Just a third of residents in Catalonia believe the independence of the region
      will be possible "in a more or less near future", El País reported, citing the
      results of a new Metroscopia survey the paper had commissioned. Two thirds of
      those living in Catalonia believe independence is an idea with "very little
      or no chance" of becoming reality. Two thirds also believe, though, that it
      is now difficult for Catalonia and the rest of Spain to reach some kind of an
      agreement on the issue. A clear majority of both Catalan respondents and Spaniards
      in other areas of the country said they thought both Mariano Rajoy and Artur
      Mas are going down the wrong path.

    - Wildfire fighters from Spain's 10 Forest Fire Reinforcement Brigades protested
      outside the Agriculture Ministry in Madrid on Monday morning after beginning
      an indefinite strike over pay, benefits and conditions. The firefighters said
      there had been no significant steps forward in talks with public company Tragsa—which
      depends on the Agriculture Ministry—despite reports of the parties moving closer
      together following partial stoppages last week. They say they accept too much
      risk in terrible conditions for too little reward. The strike affects 500 firefighters
      around Spain in the middle of a summer with very high temperatures and several
      wild fires reported each week.

    - 21 people are still in hospital in the city of Lille in northern France after
      a Spanish coach crashed in the early hours of Sunday morning while travelling
      between Bilbao and Amsterdam with a party of university students. Two of the
      21 are in a critical condition, Europa Press reported. 13 other casualties have
      now been released from hospital. The coach travelled at speed into a tunnel
      that the vehicle was too high for, ripping off the roof. The mayor of the town
      of La Madeleine said the crash could have been much worse and that "the headrests
      of some of the seats had been ripped off".

    - The end of July saw a drop in support for Podemos of over 4 percentage points,
      according to a new Metroscopia poll published in El País, the first time the
      party has fallen below 20% in that poll since last October. The PP and Spanish
      Socialist Party are drawn on 23% of the vote. The only political leader still
      to receive a positive mark from voters is Ciudadanos's Albert Rivera. The three
      most disliked leaders in Spain are Pablo Iglesias, Mariano Rajoy and Artur Mas,
      although Mr. Iglesias and Mr. Rajoy receive strong marks from voters of their
      own parties. PP and Podemos voters are also those voters who say they would
      never vote for the other party.

      of this year, an 11.5% increase compared to the first six months of 2014, Expansión
      reported, thanks to improved client profitability, commissions income and investment
      portfolio performance, and a fall in default rates. Bankia's parent group BFA
      reported a first-half profit of €1.2 billion, an increase of 66.5% on the same
      period last year. The second quarter saw a 27% increase in profit compared to
      the first three months of this year, allowing the group to close on its full-year
      target of a 10% return on equity.

    - The Café Comercial, a historic café in the centre of Madrid, often described
      as "the oldest café in Madrid", announced on Facebook on Monday morning that
      it was closing its doors immediately. The café said on its website that it opened
      in 1870 and Spanish media reported its first operating licence had been awarded
      in 1887. It was frequently the scene of literary debates and a favourite stop
      for Spanish cultural figures, across many generations. The message posted by
      the café online said that while it was "a shame" to have to announce the closure,
      the time had come and that it was grateful to its customers for their patronage.

    - The Catalan government has presented a series of proposals concerning a new
      tax model for the region if it were to secede from Spain, based on the Australian
      and Swedish revenue collection agencies and the idea of an encouraging smart
      tax in place of repressive control measures. El País reported the Catalan government
      wanted to make it clear to voters before the regional elections in September
      that it was ready to begin exercising independence. Deputy Prime Minister Soraya
      Sáenz de Santamaría said Mr. Mas's tax agency proposals were "not going anywhere".
      PP spokesman Pablo Casado said the government would not allow "any kind of separatist
      challenge".

    - A wild fire in Catalonia has burned more than 1,200 hectares of land in Odena.
      La Vanguardia reported the fire had now been stabilised, following the evacuation
      of 400 people from their homes. Investigators believe a farm accident with a
      hay making machine caused the fire and the owner, a 59-year old Spanish man,
      has made a statement to police after initially claiming he had had no relation
      to the blaze. The operation of the hay making machine, which generated sparks
      that hit stones on the ground was not prohibited given the wildfire alert level
      in force at the time the fire started.

    - The big winner of the fast-track electoral reform being proposed by Mariano
      Rajoy's Popular Party would be Mariano Rajoy's Popular Party, El Mundo reports,
      citing a data study carried out by its own journalists. The PP currently holds
      an overall majority in both the Spanish Congress and the Spanish Senate. If
      the proposals became law and were applied to May's local election results, the
      PP would win power in 219 additional towns across the country. The Spanish Socialist
      Party would lose power in 151. More broadly, conservative parties such as the
      Basque Nationalist Party or the now defunct CiU in Catalonia would benefit from
      the reform, whilst a variety of left-wing or left-wing regionalist parties would
      lose out. Albert Rivera's party Ciudadanos, considered a potential alternative
      to the PP for conservative votes, would also lose.

    - 'Ciudadanos has proposed far-reaching education reforms and called for cross-party
      agreement on a system leader Albert Rivera said was "characterised by failure
      in schools" and "sectarianism". He slammed what he termed the "omnipresent,
      Stalinist university bureaucracy" and said a series of reforms and counter-reforms
      by the Popular Party and the Spanish Socialist Party had only rendered the system
      obsolete. Ciudadanos''s economy spokesman, LSE professor Luis Garicano, said:

    - The regional government in Castilla La Mancha, led by Socialist Party (PSOE)
      First Minister Emiliano García Page, has moved to block the construction of
      a nuclear waste dump in the town of Villar de Cañas just hours after Spain’s
      Nuclear Security Council gave the green light for preliminary construction work
      to begin. El Mundo reported a regional government cabinet meeting on Tuesday
      morning had decided to increase the size of a nearby natural park and bird protection
      area from 2,500 acres to 62,000 acres, thus prohibiting any construction work
      from beginning in the area. The Spanish government wants to store radioactive
      waste there for up to 100 years.

    - Spanish electricity company Endesa reported first-half profits of 870 million
      euros between January and June 2015, a 17.1% increase compared to the previous
      year, Expansión reported. The profits increase, on total first-half revenue
      of €10.3 billion, is more than 100 million euros more than analysts were expecting.
      Endesa said the improvements were due to an increase in gross margins, especially
      in regulated activities, and the positive effect of non-recurring factors such
      as CO2 certificates.

    - Discrepant members of Podemos and United Left in Catalonia have presented a
      new breakaway political platform called Guanyem Catalunya ("Let's Win Catalonia")
      to contend the regional elections in September, Spanish media reported. The
      new platform's leaders criticised the "personalist projects and media focus"
      of the current Podemos and United Left options. The new movement "was not created
      to belong to the leader of the moment", said the organisers. A poll published
      in La Razón on Monday suggested the official Podemos list, called Catalunya
      Sí que es pot ("Yes We Can Catalonia") could win 16 seats in the 135-seat regional
      parliament.

    - The Popular Party has chosen the controversial former mayor of the town of Badalona,
      Xavier Albiol, as its new candidate for first minister in the upcoming regional
      elections in Catalonia. Mr. Albiol replaces Alicia Sánchez Camacho. Despite
      the Popular Party receiving the most votes in Badalona at the May 24 local elections,
      a lack of an overall majority meant Mr. Albiol was ousted from the town hall
      by a left-wing coalition. Controversy surrounded his election campaign after
      he promised to keep "cleaning" the town, an indirect reference to immigration,
      although he denied any such direct link when asked.

    - The UN Security Council's anti-terrorism committee has held a meeting in Madrid,
      bringing together over 200 ministers and deputy ministers from 20 countries.
      Opening the conference, Mariano Rajoy said that Spain had experience with dealing
      with terrorism, was "on the front line of the fight against terrorism", that
      "no one is free from the claws of the beast" and that he thought the terror
      threat from Islamic State could be beaten "with determination and by fighting
      together". The terror threat level in Spain was raised to four out of a total
      of five following the attack on Western tourists on a beach at a Spanish-owned
      hotel in Tunisia at the end of June.

    - Spain’s National Markets & Competition Commission (CNMC) announced a record
      €171 million fine for 20 car companies on Tuesday for practices it believes
      “constitute a cartel”, the commission said in a press release. The Spanish subsidiaries
      of Citroën, BMW, Chrysler, Chevrolet, Fiat, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai,
      Kia, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Nissan, Peugeot, Renault, Toyota and Volvo have been
      fined between €265,50 and €22.8 million. The commission says the companies,
      who dominate 91% of the Spanish car market, exchanged commercially sensitive
      and strategic information. Volkswagen Audi, SEAT and Porsche avoided a further
      €39 million in fines after collaborating with investigators.

    - Two people were injured—one of them seriously—in Barcelona yesterday following
      a shooting incident in front of the Hotel Silken, close to the popular Rambla
      area of the city, shortly after 3 p.m. on Monday. Catalan police are searching
      for the shooter, but do not believe the incident is related to terrorism. Investigators
      believe the shooter and his victims knew each other. The injured men, a Belgian
      and a British citizen, were apparently waiting for the third, who arrived and
      began shooting. Both casualties were later treated in hospital.

    - A Greek F16 that crashed on take off at Albacete's Los Llanos airbase in January
      likely did so because of a misplaced NATO checklist moving a key rudder control
      switch in the front cockpit of the two-seater jet. A report published by the
      French Defence Ministry also said a change in routine before the NATO exercise
      caused a significant alteration in the pilot's pre-takeoff habits. The F-16
      stalled just two seconds after take off and hit the ground 5.8 seconds, killing
      both pilots and nine French Air Force personnel on the ground, as well as destroying
      three other jets. The crew attempted to eject but did so outside of the ejection
      seat's safety envelope.

    - The average cost of employing a worker in Spain fell by 0.6% last year, to €30,653,
      according to new data published by the National Statistics Office on Wednesday.
      Average gross salary fell slightly, to €22,605, or 74% of the total cost. Most
      of the rest goes towards paying employees' social security contributions. The
      highest average wages in Spain are to be found in the energy and financial sectors
      and the lowest in restaurant and hotel work. The region with the highest average
      wage is Madrid and the region with the lowest average wage is Extremadura. Average
      total and salary costs have remained relatively stable since the economic crisis
      began in 2008.

    - 17 regional governments will receive €7.5 billion more in financing from the
      central government next year and Catalonia will receive the largest increase
      of all, up by 12%, compared to an average increase of 8.7%, following a meeting
      of the country's Financial & Fiscal Policy Council, which deals with regional
      funding. Spanish regions led by new Socialist Party governments, as well as
      Catalonia, Cantabria and the Canary Islands, voted against a reduction in regional
      deficit targets to 0.3% for 2016. Spanish Finance Minister Cristóbal Montoro
      said that "Catalans have to have finance guaranteed for services", given that
      a "disconnection" from Spain "is not going to happen".

    - Mariano Rajoy yesterday visited the town of Castelldefells in Catalonia to support
      the Popular Party's new candidate for first minister in the region, Xavier Albiol.
      Mr. Rajoy said Mr. Albiol had "clear ideas and the respect, affections and votes
      of his neighbours". Regarding Artur Mas's idea of turning the regional elections
      in September into a plebiscite on the secession of Catalonia from Spain, Mr.
      Rajoy said that "the law will be obeyed and if anyone wants to break it, they
      will have a problem". The Prime Minister said Mr. Albiol, who has previously
      made controversial comments about immigration in the region, has "very clear
      ideas".

    - The mayor of the town of Villar de Cañas in Castilla La Mancha has waded in
      to the debate on the construction of a new nuclear waste dump near the town,
      a decision approved by Spain's Nuclear Security Council on Monday and blocked
      by the regional Socialist Party government on Tuesday, when it announced the
      increase in size of a natural park and bird sanctuary to cover the proposed
      construction site where radioactive waste could be stored for up to 100 years.
      Popular Party mayor José María Sáiz said on Wednesday that local residents were
      "fed up with the cranes", in reference to the flocks of birds that stop to rest
      nearby during their annual migration.

      regulator CNMV, after a complaint was made about the management of the regulator
      under Julio Segura during the previous Socialist Party government, when the
      Bankia IPO was approved. El Español reported the two-month old investigation
      centres on whether or not a group of civil servants awarded operating licences
      or imposed fines in exchange for bribes, and whether or not the crimes of falsifying
      documents, bribery, threats, extortion and money laundering were committed or
      not. The CNMV is preparing a report to aid the police in their investigation.

      to 4.05 million, and by 44,286 people in seasonally adjusted terms. The government
      said in a press statement that this was the largest fall in July unemployment
      since 1998. More than half of the new jobs were created in the service sector,
      for men, and for those over the age of 25. The largest falls by region were
      recorded in Andalusia (-19,319), Galicia (-12,691) and Catalonia (-9,162). Extremadura
      recorded a rise in unemployment of 279 people. Of the 1.8 million contracts
      signed in July, 1.64 million were some kind of temporary contract, although
      the number of permanent contracts being signed is rising.

      on Tuesday that he believed 68 seats for <strong>Junts Pel Sí</strong> ("Together
      For Yes")—the joint pro-secession electoral list he is a part of—would be enough
      in the 135-seat regional parliament for the formation to push on towards a <strong>unilateral

      said: "you have a legitimate right to self-defence", adding that while formally
      these are normal regional elections, he considers them a plebiscite on secession.
      He said <strong>68 regional MPs</strong> would be enough to consider the ''yes''
      vote had won, regardless of whether or not those 68 seats were won with a majority
      of the vote. Spanish Prime Minister <strong>Mariano Rajoy</strong> said on Tuesday

    - Just a third of residents in Catalonia believe the independence of the region
      will be possible "in a more or less near future", El País <a href="http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/07/24/media/1437762916_096268.html">reported</a>,
      citing the results of a new Metroscopia survey the paper had commissioned. Two
      thirds of those living in Catalonia believe independence has "very little or
      no chance" of becoming reality and that it is now difficult for Catalonia and
      the rest of Spain to reach agreement on the issue. A clear majority of both
      Catalan respondents and Spaniards in other parts of the country said they thought
      both Mariano Rajoy and Artur Mas were approaching the dispute in the wrong way.
