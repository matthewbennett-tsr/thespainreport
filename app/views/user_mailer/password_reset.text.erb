Hi,

To reset your password, click this link:

<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.password_reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

The link is valid for one hour (60 minutes).

Your password must be at least 15 characters long and include one capital letter and one space.

You may choose an easy-to-remember pass phrase like "I want to go to Spain!" or "I love The Spain Report".

You do not have to include symbols or numbers, but you may do so if you wish to.

If you did not request this e-mail, just ignore it and your current password will continue to work.

Kindest regards,

Matthew Bennett
