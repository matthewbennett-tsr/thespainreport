Hi,

To reset your password, click this link (valid for one hour):

<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.password_reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

Choose an easy-to-remember pass phrase like "I want to go to Spain!" or "I love The Spain Report".

Just make sure it is at least 11 characters long and includes a capital letter and a space.

You do not have to include symbols or numbers, but you can do if you want to.

If you did not request this e-mail, just ignore it and your current password will continue to work.

Kindest regards,
