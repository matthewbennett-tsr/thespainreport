			<strong>How Many Users:</strong> 
			Everybody is welcome: friends, family, school groups, teams, organisations or companies.
			It's very easy to add your users after subscribing, or we can help you:
			<div style="margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
				<%= image_tag "add-users-example.jpg", :width => '250' %>
			</div>
		</p>
		<p class="mb-10">
			<strong>Which Plan:</strong> 
			If you select "one story" (Podemos, Catalan independence, Spain & Brexit, etc.), you can change it once every 30 days.
			If, like most people, you want to follow and read lots of interesting Spain stories, choose "all stories".
