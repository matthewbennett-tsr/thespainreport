	<p>“Your reporting and comment are excellent – please keep up the good work! As a British person resident in Catalonia for the past 13 years, I really appreciate your objective and well written reporting of politics in Spain.“—John, Catalonia</p>
	<p>“I enjoy reading The Spain Report and it’s my go to when I want to understand the news in Spain. My Spanish is not yet good enough for me to grasp all I read in the Spanish press. Also I find your editorial line is more independent, and keener to question the news as you report it.“—Geoff</p>
	<p>"I've lived here for the last 25 years. I have a Spanish family and speak a lot more Spanish than I do English.  I'm an avid follower of Spanish politics and very concerned about the lack of transparency, accuracy and impartiality in the Spanish Press. I'm a paid subscriber to El Diario and now to The Spain Report. I also read El Mundo and El Pais on a daily basis and, when I need a dose of humour, I check out what Marhuenda has to say.  I do feel you have your finger on the pulse of the Spain of today - we need as much independent reporting as possible.  Keep up the good work!"—Simon</p>
	<p>“Since my daughter has lived in Spain for many years and is now with a Spanish partner, I have taken up interest in Spain. But not being able to read or speak Spanish (to my regret), your initiative is ideal for me.“—Aad, Holland</p>
	<p>"I recently moved to Spain in August 2015, and am in the process of selling my house in the UK and settling permanently in Spain. A really important part of becoming an immigrant, as indeed I am, is understanding the nuances of Spanish cultural, social and political life. Although I am learning Spanish I have a long way to go before my Spanish will reach the competence necessary for this […] The English speaking newspapers in Spain in the main seem to have more in common with UK redtops than in serious analysis, and I have found them on occasion to be UK centric, prejudiced or even offensive"—Jennifer</p>
	<p>“I just love your editorial updates. You are erudite and succinct like no other commentator I have found, whats more, from an editorial stand point, you are consistent and up to the minute.“—Edward, Canary Islands</p>
	<p>“I follow all your stuff on twitter and it is of excellent quality.“—Cathal, Dublin</p>
	<p>“Just wanted to let you know that I just subscribed and it was easier. The articles that you are writing are exactly what I want to read about – the employment situation, the corruption and what I need to look out for.“—Carlene, Canada</p>
	<p>“I have been a subscriber to The Spain Report for a few months and it is a cracking read: insightful, well written and independent. How refreshing it is not having to read a load of cut and pasted press releases from the corrupt cronies “running” the joint. This story was one of the best. It could be a candidate for Private Eye’s Funny Old World column.…I subscribed to TSR as it covers important news with analysis and is delivered in a convenient format.“—Edward, Gibraltar</p>
	<p>“If you want regular #news from #Spain in English, please subscribe to @thespainreport. It’ll be money well spent. Great resource. #media“—Patrick, London</p>
